Wonder woman is still better
Carol Danvers punches an old woman in the face. Great way to tease a skrull appearing in the movie.
Meh!! Hopefully, the next trailer is better! Its not like how Wonder Woman first trailer was now that was Epic the movie was ok to me but the Wonder Woman Trailer was Epic!!!
The highlight of this trailer was her punching the old helpless woman👿😈
To get the effect they want they need this needs to be 'Wonder Woman'... this may actually end up being 'Green Lantern' without the horrible 'jokes.'
Me: I was just here to see old comments on Wonder Woman saying it would be bad and then making them wrong
Please stop inserting women in to every film just for the sake of "diversity"
Captain Marvel is a woman ????????????
Feminist alarm.
Not amazing but, still looks better than Wonder Woman.
this is the first female lead marvel movie. Wow that amazing
What the media is trying to push is that we do not need a Superman or Supermen, anymore. The women's movement is a pretext that women are superior to men in every form. If, you truly believe that-there is a small island you can live on (Theone)(Greek -the one)  called Themyscira....Other than that, I will go and welcome the new...er Capt. and just watch the film take off... And it will. Men, we can regroup and hope in the sequel that the original Captain Marvel will show up with some big balls. And maybe he can lead -we are MEN, hear us roar LOUDER.!!! Keep looking up in the sky. Capt. Marvel will be great to watch. Did you hear that Clark Kent.
They finally made a movie that everyone can hate on together instead of just a small group of people. It's so confusing that not even a feminist who's moist from having a female superhero as the main character can defend it since she straight up punched out an old woman with no context.
The future is female!❤
Is anyone going to take into account that she hit an elderly woman😂
Nice trailer for Wonder woman.
"But now these parts (Europe, Asia and Africa, the three continents of the Ptolemaic geography) have been extensively explored and a fourth part has been discovered by Americus Vespuccius (the Latin form of Vespucci’s name), I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part after Americus, who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, and so to name it Amerige, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women."
I can’t wait for this!!! I love Wonder Woman!!!
eww the main person is a women
No thanks, I will spend my money on Aquaman and Wonder Woman.
72k dislikes went to see venom, I’ll save my money and time and go see Captain Marvel. They stick to the source material and to a feminist agenda. Jude Law’s Mar Vell will be here mentor and he’s one of the most powerful hero’s in the universe.
Ripley from Alien didn't even make me feel like I was watching a woman, it was just awesome through & through.
I would be more excited but the promotion keeps making her a “female” hero. Why can’t they just make her a hero. Like in a magazine they said the future is female or some shit. I love the character, but she’s a cool hero, not female hero.
This is sick! Finally I'm in love with a woman superhero!!
She just punch an old woman
People say that Marvel are non feminist or treat women not that greatly as DC does but according to me they have made a female as biggest hero of MCU... Like she knows about Thanos and she might stop him and this story they were working since past 10yrs.... So according to me they have made their point that they never undertreated women....
Marvel first Female lead Superhero 
Finally a female superhero gets her own film
Let me guess, it’ll be a subpar movie that will shatter records because it has a female lead.
i thought captain marvel is weraring underwear like wonderwoman in dc. such a disappointment. i like superhero girls wearing underwear only. i think captain marvel is a lesbian.
Why do I have a this *"it will have a bad feminist message"* feeling?
Covered neck to toe in leather... Hold one one god dang minute... Some feminists are pro flesh... Its all empowerment girls... And then some women are like... Cover everything up girls (bit Muslim if you ask me) dont let those evil males get their grimy eyes on you or they will objectify you... Oh god dread the thought.... Make your mind up ladies. BTW, this covered muslim capt. Marvel looks shit... They should have found a director with the balls and an actress with the self confidence (sorry, not any of those fatties) to show some leg.... Man this film looks shit.
So female green lantern is what I'm getting to.
Oh damn Green Lantern female edition!
Okay but does anyone think that "Her, A Hero" should be like a feminist slogan or something? It just kinda seems perfect for that. This is an amazing trailer btw, I almost fell out of my chair when I saw Phil.
She just punched a old woman (Probaly was a bad guy/girl xD)
Finally a real trailer. Not something crappy trailer with other Marvel movies obviously slap together passing as this trailer. And why the hell did she just punching old woman? Anybody else see that part?
As if Women weren't empowered enough in todays society... Bring us the Adam Warlock movie like we really wanted
Man i hate it . Not because that she is a woman but she is too over power even superman and goku are not that over powered by their author.
More female super heros. :( thanks for the suck writing marvel.
Captian Marvel Is A Woman ? 
This chick is about to surpass Wonder Woman...
*Captain marvel - the movie that we all should be proud of because her gender is a female, while she was stripped of most of her feminity from the comics (feminine outfit was ditched, short butch hairstlyle in the comics, pretty much acts like a dude). But yeah we should all be glad because her gender is a female, but that's pretty much all that's feminine about her. I would like it more if htey made a movie about a heroINE that was actually feminine, instead of this*
Somebody please get this women a thanos
Female superhero? No money from me.
Some of the tralier is cool however as a whole it was a bit unimpressive and underwhelming... hoping that Marvel don't go all feminist on us, it's cool that she's a girl but don't beat it into us! We get it and it doesn't need to be mentioned in the film. But lastly I do have faith in Marvel so I hope it is great and it probably will be! They do seem to be the one movie Company that never really has a film of there's flop! It's exciting to see where Marvel is going to go from here when it comes to new characters and it being the 10th anniversary but will be sad saying goodbye to the old characters.. sucks that there won't be more thor, Iron Man and cap!
First Wonder Woman now Captain Marvel if this goes well which I mean c'mon why would it not then maybe we can get a good Supergirl/ Power girl movie and let the women do what they do for awhile the men in marvel and DC need to sit on the bench for awhile
It would be really funny if the old woman is not some skrull in disguise, but an actual old woman.
Best feminist movie for 2019...
Women can't be Superheroes. Next.
Damn,now a women will save world😭😭
Hollywood is really controlled by the feminist movement. I thought I'd never say this but its true.....its true.
Gonna be my first pass. This is more boring than Wonder Woman.
The hype is real for SHAZAM and Wonder woman 1984
Captain Marvel is women?
I punching an old woman without context is no ok
Finally Marvel has a female superhero movie
Ohhh Marvel's Superman ... or should I say Superwoman ...
can we get at least one female super heroine with some knockers on her, please?
like if captain marvel should have been  a male not female 🔥🔥
Here comes the cringey “I’m a strong woman don’t need a man” jokes that are gonna reck this movie just like racist black panther jokes
Wonder Woman was much better !
Mannn.... I would die for this women
Okay this is epic but women still need to rise up
The movie looks great but captain marvel isn't sexy on the comics & Brie Larson isn't sexy either(nobody can top gal gadot as Wonder Woman,now that's sexy)these are facts.
Wonderwoman will kick her @$$
  And they complain that Supes is overpowered!  Go figure.  Supes?  Powerful?  Not okay!!!!!  Fem?  Feminist shero?  No problem!  Ah.... ok...  now I see why I won't be in any line to see this in theaters in 2019.
1:27 Yes Marvel, I've already seen that she is a woman. And there was nothing special about it until you pointed it out.
"Evacuate the city, engage all defenses and get this old woman a shield"
Pc crap strikes again.... why do they feel the need to change captain marvel to a chic? Captain marvel was a kickass character, and he was a dude. If the femnazis out there want to see strong women in powerful roles then maybe they should create more characters like black widow or wonderwoman. Changing established characters is just stupid and all it does is weaken a once strong character.
I don't think this movie will be as good as wonder women
would like to see more women in the cast tho
female lead superheroes
She's a woman so of course everybody is going to flock to this new Marvel movie.
That poor old woman
I wonder where are those fanboys who called wonder woman a copy of captain america and thor. It would be funny to hear from them about this film being a copy of green lantern and MOS
Wonder women of marvel 😁
I’m rooting for a female MCU team up movie ☺️☺️☺️
Should have casted another woman she doesnt seem right for the role. She doesnt even seem like shes trying
Really Tired of euro women heroes especially after the "wrong apartment shooting" !!
Did no one see her in King Kong?  Her acting was atrocious so I have to ask why her?  Was no one else available??  I can think of so many female actors better suited for this role.  Asian or Black American women didn't audition?  (Yes, I am extremely pale)  
next up: Christ Jesus portrayed by a gender fluid (female) black homosexual down syndrome psychopath atheist CHILD
I really don't get it....MCU had cap, doc strange, Spider-Man, thor with them. And anyone among these could have easily been one of the most powerful avengers till date. But no...MCU wants to keep on extending their universe so they introduce a female superhero who arrives in 2018 and takes the place of all of our childhood fav superheroes who have been there with MCU for the past 10 yrs or so.
Plot twist: 1:30 it's actually an old woman
Another Hollywood Politically Correct statement that a woman can do a mans job. Originally she was Ms. Marvel. Guess creating life inside one body doesn’t make you better than a man anymore.  😂🤣😅. The movie will flop! Watch...lol! FYI. Women have always been more important to life...without them we’d have no life. Duh!
Why does this remind me of Thor 2011 and Wonder Woman 2017 like that just smashed it up together in one!?
*Females are taking over*
Basically a wonder woman rip off
No Hype for it. I don't want a Female Superhero. It's way too fictional!
1st ever MARVEL trailer I wasn't  hyped about hope they don't ruin the 1st ever women superhero movie. 😭
Marvel's answer to Wonder Woman AND showing DC how they should have done Green Lantern.......EPIC!
Feminism isn’t nothing but women wanting to be worshipped.
Marvel's first "blockbuster" female lead...looks pretty badass!!
1) Caption Marvel is a women😂 it will suit more if captain Marvel is guy just like captain America. 
I like it but they trying to make it like Wonder Woman
Never forget Captain Marvel is just female Superman.
This woman has the whole "G.I. JANE" demi Moore look. Which is boring as all hell. 
she is the real wonder woman
POST THOUGHTS THOUGHTS: It just occurred to me, they want female Saitama! Look at her, no facial expressions, scene where she is upside down gave me a good laugh with that face and she is probably so op that even Thanos is like a bug to her. It's basically Saitama, but without any charm, personality or comedy. Oh yeah, no actual comedy in here. Not a good sign. And that emphasis on HER in word Hero. Yare yare daze.
Didn't the X-woman Rogue kill Captain Marvel back in the '70s or '80s???
I liked this Wonder woman trailer...  Waiiit whaat?😂
Love to see that this trailer is getting dragged but seriously dudes.... because it's a female hero and she may help reverse the snap you idiots are mad? Like how fragile can your "masculinity" be
It looks underwhelming. I am a woman. I am not a man or a bot.
I get the trailer's vibe. It's like if you woke Cap up after being frozen but you can't trust your memories, you see people who aren't what they seem, and you have a whole world to rediscover all while viewing everything from the standpoint of a soldier. Wonderwoman was both comedic and serious when she was learning of the world of man in the recent film. I know we will see the fun side of Brie playing Captain Marvel bleed through into the character, but that wasn't the point of this trailer.
Who else thinks black widow should have been the first female to have her own movie in the mcu
she is not even 1% of thanos power , stop your feminist shit, its embarassing
3 things,. 1. Can y'all stop calling her wonder woman and comparing this to wonder woman, 2. The old lady captain marvel hit was a skrull, so y'all can stop tripping about it,  3. Y'all complaining and hating on trailer, ain't seen the movie, and already judging it,  smh,
Feminists be like on wings once again
Captian Marvel doesnt sound like a female role. Im not a superhero buff so I hadnt even heard of her until recently. I just think of a man when I hear the word Captain.
Wait... so WonderWoman is NOT in this movie?
For all of you calling this a wonder woman rip off. You should go back and catch on with your comics knowledge. Pfft
Wow a woman badass?!?! I want to see that! “Said no one ever”
Wonder Woman > Whatever bullshit this is
ha ha that looks like a female version of the green lantern
Is she gonna save the universe with punching an old women WTF
You agree that womans cant be captains?  The Hero Word is 100% masculine .
DC: Yeah well we're the only ones who have a successful comic book film with a female lead.
I hate women and minorities
why every movie starting to have woman as the heroes ?
I haven't seen a lead female character with the same facial expression since Twilight.
I Love Wonder Woman
Wait is this the first female lead MCU movie?!
*Punches an old woman's face*
Wow Wonder Woman 2 looks good.
Another Wonder Woman
Marvel, this still feels like Wonder Woman to me. Different story, but several major similarities
Any one notice they highlighted the her in a hero because this is their first movie with a female lead
At 1:30 ☺old woman is actually thanos👣👣. And as captain marvel has watched infinity war....She *aimed for the head*
1:30 now we know why she wasn't there for all those years.  She got inprisioned for punching that old woman's jaw off who turned out to not be a skrull.
That old woman is a Skrull, calling it now!
People are mad dissing on the trailer but I thought it looked pretty good, and I’m sincerely hoping that the movie turns out to be really good, also people noting the “wooden” acting, but I almost think it was intentional given that in all the shots where she has that bland expression it is presumably because she is confused, not knowing what is real or what to believe. Also as for her smacking the old lady, the woman was probably a Skrull/Kree (Can’t remember which one can shapeshift and which one Captain Marvel is associated with)
You really see who’s sexist when they’re already discounting the movie just because it has a female lead...
Woman superheroes
Hits old woman with great force
I think we are starting to see the fall of the MCU due to Disney's influence. Im more pissed how the skrulls look then anything but i find it hard to see her as a "kick ass warrior women".... We need Wonder Women... lol
Why did she punch an old woman?
Showing it's ok to punch old woman.....ok marvel
I fuckin love MCU and Marvel but personally i dont like this hero, at least not in the MCU, i get that they need to put a strong female characters for the public eye but cmmon if she defeats Thanos all alone or mostly shell defeat Thanos imma be mad with MCU and itll be a wack ending to one of the greatest franchise ever
@1:28 they purposely showed "HER" before hero...hmmmmm another feminist agenda?
she hits an old woman
Ok but no thanks we already had a female captain America movie already it’s called wonder women
Looks like superman and wonder woman combined, not to excited about this hero, If avenger win because of her then the whole 10 year set up was waste of time
Why does she hit the old woman tho?
Why is there always an "agenda" with people if there is a powerful female led movie? Male's have dominated as leads in film for years. What if you weren't represented like you wanted to be? Wouldn't you want to see a film that did?
No ones gonna mention how they just copied wonder woman
Captain Marvel: Old Woman 1:31
Diana Prince is the real Feminist.
Captain Marvel trailer 1 was great but wonder women comic con trailer 1 was even better. The CGI etc was better in wonder women comic con trailer one than on Captain Marvel comic con trailer one. That too wonder women comic con trailer one was released 11 months before its release date, whereas captain marvel teaser released 6 months before its release date.
Ronan, and captain marvel is punching a old woman, i need see that in my poor TV
Am I sexist for thinking she seems horribly miscast? I love her and she's an amazing actress but to me she doesn't look like  a super hero at all. her outfit in the beginning looks like it doesn't fit her and she got it off amazon. wonder woman, black widow, the bald female warriors from black panther. All amazing women superheros but this... looks so low budget.. :/ im disappointed
Ok, sigh, let’s see what happens, hope they didn’t do this just to keep these screaming women from boycotting Marvel, lol, and can they get people interested in her character in time
Bcow female character is a hero here so I want a weak male character whom she love and then have to manage action and love life on the same time.
I am a grown ass woman legitimately crying at how freaking fierce and awesome this looks. Been dreading this one as Captain Marvel is my fav...but I think it’s gonna be ok!!!!! Mainly cuz HELMET MOHAWK!!!!!!
Of course they didn't go with the real cpt. Marvel. They had to go with the less liked female spin off. Why sacrifice quality like that?
captain Marvel vs Wonderwoman, Who would win?
When you try to copy DC (Wonderwoman)
Waiting for all the butthurt conservatives to cry about having a female lead
Proceeds to punch elderly woman in the face
And ya, Wonder Woman 84 is coming.✌️✌️✌️
“Wonder Woman 2 lite”
It's like watching the female version of Keanu Reeves, lol.
I see feminist people, Mr stark I dont feel good...
The first marvel female superhero to get her standalone movie
This should keep the feminists happy
Why’d she punch dat woman
Another horrible female lead superhero movie, PASS.
I swear there better not be a sad scene where she legit punches a sweet old woman
Just another strong, independent, pretty, young, perfect female goddess that Hollywood puts up in movies. 
Sexist shitheads: the feminists are taking over, *sings* I'm an adult virgin
strong woman have mostly been kept in the back ground but slowly getting to come foreword. 
Women fighter pilots.. is this going to be a comedy? Where's topper Harley?
Looks boring and cliche, but im sure all the women will go see it .
Hey Disney. No one besides feminists and sexist people who live in their parent’s basement care if your super hero is a woman. No one cares.
Whats up with all the bullshit female lead roles. Im not buying it.
Wonder Woman 2 looks better. Where's Rise of the Phoenix? Where's the Black Widow movie? Eh, this movie looks like it will almost be as good as Ant-man. Skip.
I was honestly turned off to this movie because of all the feminist BS that Brie Larson has been spewing. But I'm gonna be honest, this was pretty good and got me interested in the movie. As long as the movie isn't trying to push an agenda or some message about feminism or something and marvel is just tying to make a good movie that has a female lead like DC did with Wonder Woman, then I'm all for it. I can separate the artist from the artwork. I'm gonna wait for reviews though before I spend any money to go see this.
Vs wonder woman please
this woman has no emotional range at all. she doesn't need to smile but do something lol
Also, I know some of these comments are just dudebros who are upset that it's a superhero movie (marvel no less) with a female lead and the sexism within the mcu Fandom is obvious.
However, I do think its a terrible trailer. The scenes the editors decided to pick up are the most cliches imaginable: the hero jumping on a moving train, walking in slow motion to the sunset, the line "I'm not what you think I am" (in fact just imagine she says "I am what you think I am: a regular woman with no powers")
Btw finally! Marvel Superman Woman's trailer is here!!!
I Can Keep Going And Not Stop But Seem's To Me Like Women Need All Of This To Feel Good About Their Selve's That's Why Marvel Studio's And Many Other's Are Making Movie's To Inspire Women Yeah Women Need This Otherwise They Might Die Thinking World Is Of Men And It's Ok I Get It Women Actually Really Need This I Understand Good Job Marvel Studio's Uffff Someone Please Shoot Me Lol's "Captain Marvel" For God Sake Did This Really Had To Happen Man Please Understand This Not Every Super Hero Need's A Super-heroine Or A  Female Gender Please Stop Being Full Of Shit Because I Know Very well Wolverina Is Coming Soon Also Just Like Captain America/Marvel I Mean The Ending Of Wolverine Made It Very Very Clear Now Please Don't Kill Spiderman  Atleast Lol's
Looks awesome. I wonder how many feminist lines Disney is going to throw into it.
Honestly I have zero problem with female super heros as long as they were females when they originated. Like Wonder woman which was the best woman superhero movie ever bar none. This re - written crap is getting ridiculous. Can anyone explain why this keeps happening? All these different versions of comics are really confusing my brain lol.
Did she just punch an old woman. damn gurl
They should've pick another woman but it's whateva
We now have superwoman... 
Please dont Make this movie about her being a woman. Make it about her being a kickass hero. No social justice bullshit. Just make a good movie and a good cameo. All I ask
1:31 she just beat an old woman
ok so captain marvel bleeds every 4 weeks? WOW!! aren't the feminists having a scissoring fest right now.
oh look they made the lead character a women, so unpredictable......
Why she hit the old woman
1:31 old woman? Why? What did she do to you? =)
Feminists are gonna bag this movie
Wonder Woman, who?
Reminds me of Wonder Woman a lot
I am not being sexist here....but women superheros doesn't give that much of fight and action like male superheros(ironman,hulk,thor,cap) does....just my opinion
Waiting for all the people to complain about the main character being a woman lol
So I watched this and the first Wonder Woman trailer back to back. Guess which one actually got me excited to watch their movie? I think people are having a problem with this trailer do to the editing and epic music that doesn't sound so epic. Your standard fade in and out of a black screen. And just some wired editing with the voices. ALSO WILL IT KILL ANYONE TO SHOW SOME EMOTION IN THIS VIDEO! CAUSE IF YOU DON'T CARE WHY SHOULD THE AUDIENCE!
I'm not surprised feminist propaganda like this is just objectively meh in equality. Our culture is sick and people miss better less insane times.
Now we can say she's the last woman standing.
Just watch wonder woman, that's how you handle a character.
She ain’t no Wonder Woman that’s for sure.
Did she seriously hit an old woman in the face...? Wtf Marvel? xD
Reading the comments really does show that men can’t let women have ONE superhero movie for themselves huh
Eh, looks alright. Probably better than Black Panther. But obviously people will praise it infinitely for including a woman.
Female makes it a shitty tralier
Captain Marvel punches a elder woman (which may or may not be an actual Villain)
What if I made a batman  movie where Cat Woman was a man? Everybody would lose their shit.
has it been a female all this long or was it decided that it's a good suggestion to make a female Captain Marvel due to the fact that DC Universe studio has Wonder Women as the second strongest hero ..
This movie is putting Wonder Woman in the ground
Its nt bad trailer,  its jst d main character is a woman as a *hero* so ppl r likely to complain.  Half of d ppl watched infinity war nt bcuz dey love marvel jst bcuz it had so many stars in it,  hypocrisy 😂😂. Fr me dis trailer ain't that bad.
All the young male marvel Stan’s really irritate me, yea she’s a woman but she can kick all of the avengers asses easy 😂
Women are smart, and funny too.
Dear people who are saying "omg, people should care about the story and not about the fact Captain Marvel is a woman":
Finally! Marvel made an all black movie and know a woman movie!
Bull shit we want the avengers not this female shit
1:40 is that female Batman
Woman movie better than male movie because woman movie have 1 million likes and male movie is just 1 hundred thousand likes only . ( I'm am crying , I just a male . )
Captain Marvel vs Wonder Woman lol, 😂😂😂😂 epic
Feminist just achieve orgasm
the trailer was not horrible just that there are people who do not accept that wonder woman is not the only superheroine and not just talking about DC or MARVEL ....... if not XMEN and 4 fantastic ..... anyway Any opinion is respected ...... but the bad trailer is not ...... this incredible does not spoiler almost like many trailers do when you go to the movies nothing surprises you ... because they have already shown it a clear example was the jurassic world the fallen kingdom
Sorry but this looks like a shampoo commercial, a proactive commercial, a Feminazi (didn't say feminist) commercial and a CW series trailer all in one. This is pretty bad.
This is the first marvel movie that I think I gonna be boring. Not because there is a female hero(like if you think the same😑😑😑😑😑🤐)
Give me a reason,  why a women can be a Captain 🤔🤔
Wow.  She is also going to be in Avengers 4 shortly after this.  Feels like when Wonder Woman came out and then Gal Gadot returned a few months later for Justice League.
I'm so excited to see the first independent marvel female film! I hope it's good!
But Wonder woman is better than captain marvel 👍
damn The way she slapped that old women lmao
"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."
damn she straight up punched an elderly woman
Meh. Doesn't look great but I was pleasantly surprised by Wonder woman so maybe this will do the same
You just can't slap an old woman
Hey captain , that's very rude when you punch a Old Woman . 😫
3. Because its just a movie made for feminist, because any movie or show with a girl as the main lead is automatically a feminist movie/show
I will enjoy this in spite of third-wave feminist 😁
Wonder woman vs captain marvel
who else would want to know who that old woman she punched was?
This movie seems so rushed coz DC did a woman oriented movie and Marvel never ever tried that success formula. 
If feminists truly want equality, then why do they keep putting women up while tearing men down?
Is she woman Green lantern? 😎😎😎😎😎
11 male super hero movies in a decade all of a sudden 1 female superhero comes along and everyone looses there shit.
Did she just punch an old women?
This looks so much better than Wonder Woman's film.
1:30 - WTF?!?!??!! Did She just hit a poor old woman!!?! 
You MCU fans are in for disappointment. Enjoy your new forced ethic diversity, LGBTQ, and feminist superhero characters.
Okay. Im not a hater but i still think they got the wrong actress. She doesnt look like someone who can compete with Wonder Woman
I'm going to punch an old women after watching this trailer.
I loved the trailer but I would prefer Wonder Woman than this.
nobody talking about the truth that the old woman captain marvel hit is a skrull....instead making fun of the scene!!
I went into this trailer without expectations and now that its over, I still don't have any. Its just "there". The "A *HER* O"-bit rubs me a bit the wrong way (yes, we can see she's female, why do you need to draw attention to that fact? Also, there *is* the word *Heroine* ...) On the other hand, this film will have Sam Jackson, good ol Clark Gregg, Lee Pace and Jude Law... sp lets wait and see. I want to have faith in Kevin Feige.
1:31 Did she just punch an old woman in the face?!
Basically, a feminist version of green lantern
Anyone else watching wish they were watching black widow or Wonder Woman?  Damn I’m a sexist.  This chick reminds me of a girl I dated one summer at the beach.  Dumb as a box of rocks. Like lobotomized or some shit.  Meh I’m a creep I’m sure it’ll be a huge hit
So basically a modified female version of Superman and Green Lantern?😩😠. I thought this was going to freaking continue Infinity War
a superhero women 
1:30 did she just slap the old woman?
Female version green lantern
oh no its a woman everyone knows the real Captain Marvel is Mar Vel damn those feminazis *foams at the mouth* male genocide
Gonna say it, I'm a little worried they're gonna pull the "strong female character" card and make her automatically better than every other hero and have thanos not stand a chance. I say this because this lady doesn't seem to have a personality whatsoever and is shaping up to be a Mary sue
Saw Captain Marvel has been cast as a woman,
So all the female lead superhero movies are either stupid or boring or both. That’s unfortunate.
Did she just right hook an 80 year old women? 
Marvel's Track record > DC Fans saying this won't be good/ Its no Wonder Woman... based pm a teaser.
Why a powerful independent female character makes man uncomfortable while a powerful male character dont do same for women.
I feel like Marvel is inflicting this bland character on us....not half as interesting as Wonder Woman.  Felt like a student film ..... Borrrrrrrring
Let's see if it's better than wonder woman, I think wonder woman is best
Meh... it looks average. OR maybe it's just FINALLY a good trailer without all the best scenes and without telling us the story? I'll watch it but... really, this green power ranger suit. She does not even look like a powerful woman.
Please don't ruin this potentially good movie with feminist agenda. Literally every other female hero movie has been ruined by it.
Evacuate the city, engage all defences, and get this woman a Thanos.
Her: **punches old woman in face**
Hey Marvel! You want your next R Rated flick? Spider Woman! Triple agent, ties into the skrull hunting alluded in this trailer, Fury's already underground in the MCU...do it! Pull no punches!
Wonder woman trailer > captain marvel trailer
Yes, now ask her about her feminist agenda...
This looks like some feminist bullshit
I like Marvel, I like Women, I like Superheroes...so how come I don't like this trailer?
I just wanna see why the old woman was hit lmfao
as expected looks like because its a female led film  all female led films are all usually shit
this seems like a huge let  down to the big build up, not only cause she is like a random women but it just seems weak
Guys do you all think captain marvel movie will be better than Wonder Woman movie 🎥.????
I'm sorry but WW will forever be the all time female superhero movie. Stay down Marvel....stay down. Lol
I was a little disappointed when I heard Brie Larson was playing arguably the most kickass (female) superhero of all time, but still thought they could pull together a good movie out of it. After watching this trailer and seeing her making the same let-me-speak-to-your-manager expression throughout I'm very underwhelmed. This is one of my favourite superheroes, why does she always look so damn bored?
Female main character.. we know this movie a flop.
DC: We made the best Female Super hero movie
Okay, i laughed way too much as she just hit the old woman in the bus.
Hey look, a movie that isn't replacing fan favourite heroes and is actually using an original female character
Where are the damn feminists? 😂
actually,  the Universe is full of GAL GADOT fans, and they can't tolerate a fully clothed woman 😁
Captain Marvel punching an old woman? Wow
Wonder Woman OR Captain Marvel....?
This movie is going to suck cause it has women in it.
Junk. All the new marvel movies are going to be feminist garbage, woman leading men and kicking their asses. No Thanks
and I sure that no DC fan will wonder woman blah blah blah and put in top ten while winter soldier is not in the
But bravo!!! What an introduction to a female hero!
Alright so here comes the streams of comment that are either being called feminists, sexist, or stupid. Everyone has a right to an opinion, regardless if you disagree or not, be respectful. 
how can women be stronger than men ??
I'm so tired of all these female roles it so annoying
Wonder.....ops wrong female superhero
*Slapping old women*
In DCU Captain Marvel is a Guy and he was created first then MCU came along, yeeted their hero and made her a female.
A all female marvel movie THE FEMINISTS ARE TAKING OVER
Women in the USAAF??? Nice joke.
If the movie is anything like the trailer, they will have to do better than this if they plan to make this Marvel's version of Wonder Woman.
Feminist shit!!!!!!!😒😒😒👎👎👎
idk that captain marvel is a woman??😵😵😵
This has a lot of potential! I’m glad they didn’t give us too much information so we can’t figure out the plot quite yet. And while she seems like a great actress, i just don’t think she fits the role?? Like when i think captain marvel, i think a very strong woman with a confident voice and aura. Not saying she can’t prove to have any of those things, but i just didn’t see it. i mean, it was only a 2 minute video; it might be better then i think
I hope they don't fill this with feminist shit
wonder woman but in mcu!
What a disappointment, the best women of all time to save the universe!
they cant find a real woman for this role? Look how perfectly they cast Wonder Woman
Better than Wonderwoman theme in BVS
Leave it to the main actor who's a man-hating feminist to prove her superiority to the "oppressive male scum."
I hope its good? Trailer didn't really grab me like previous marvel films. Like something is missing. But then again I didn't read the comics so I don't know who she is. Looks like a lot happening, backstory wise. She's going to be a new character to a lot of people. Hope it balances well with the action. So far I'm kinda just on board. Really looking forward to the first female in a starring role in a Marvel film. DC kicked ass with Wonder Woman. Gotta step it up. Still holding out for that black widow solo film. Her backstory would be awesome.
Honestly felt the DC counterpart was better this time. Wonder Woman (plus her debut in Bats vs Supes) was badass af. Don't know if it's lack of acting prowess on Brie Larson's part or was this depiction of Cap Marv just kinda...ehh. Feels more like a special guest appearance on Agents of SHIELD than a full length film.
A woman will save the MCU? *Seems legit* Jude Law is in it so it will be alright; he's a man's man! Just kidding I really want to see it, too bad is going to be 95% flash backs.
Okay ok looks more serious than guardians maybe they trying to capture what wonder woman did
1:30 Makes me feel so sad and guilty inside when she punches the old woman... (;-;)
BTW:  Play this without sound.  It may be the most ridiculous thing ever.  This actress has the most generic white female look yet in an action  movie.
This reminds of wonder women
For some reason I clicked on a Wonder Woman trailer and when I saw the comments 
The best way to go for a superhero movie with a female lead
*Punches an old woman*
OMG, its Jules and Vincent except this time Vincent turned into a white woman.
I hate it when they force women into being superheros in live action movies. Comics are fine but the real shit is too corrny!
The old women who was hit by Captain Marvel is the scrull.
Great now marval is inspired by dc for wonder woman.
Also the idiots saying this is pro feminist, because it says "her" before it says "Hero" pay attention.  It's actually saying "what makes her a hero"!
Meh Wonder Woman is better!
I hope this is just a bad trailer because this just has me feeling like I’m watching a Zach Snyder film with CW CGI.  Ugly tint, uninteresting costumes, and the characters are robots.  The part where she’s shooting the beams out of her hands and when she’s powering up at the end just look cringey.  Yet, feminists will probably claim if you dislike the movie you’re sexist, when they should be bitching at hollywood for being unable to get female lead action movies down.  Of course this is all assuming the movie is properly represented by the trailer, however, I’m unsure because Marvel has nailed the trailers for years, I just can’t see them screwing up this bad.
Superman is a woman?
feminist propaganda so pass
*Why are there so many feminist movies lately??*
SO... Marvel's Wonder Woman?
Respect your elders woman!!!!!!
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old woman
Looks all right. Hopefully we see more of the cosmic side of the Marvel Universe, but I feel like they're gonna make her female Green Lantern, which is just... weird. Still, high hopes. The movie looks cool. Also, SHE JUST PUNCHED AN OLD LADY! I can't wait to see how that plays out, lol.
Wonder women Vs Worst CM
Why does she have to be white and cis gendered? Couldn't Marvel have cast a transgender woman of color? I'm so disappointed in another whitewashed character.
I have no doubt that Ms. Marvel will be a big help in beating Thanos. But she better not just come in and kick his ass single handed just because “I’m a woman and I can be just as strong as the strongest person here!” Even if she just gets the final blow it’s gonna piss off fans. Not because they’re sexist, but because it’s a new character stealing the win from characters we’ve been watching for ten years. Tony, Thor, Cap. They deserve to be the ones that take him down. Not some newcomer trying to please feminists. Marvel, please listen to your fanbase and don’t hand her the win. Give it to Black Widow if you must, just not someone you just introduced.
Hero is a masculine concept. There’s no difference turning a woman into the hero.
It’s either going to be a Wonder Woman-tier of mediocrity or really good. There’s no in between with this style of film.
So......... i prefer wonderwoman.
That’s looks way better than Wonder Woman!
Looks like Captain Marvel is going to kick Wonder Womans ass
Please be the first good female superhero movie have mar-vel but don’t make it all about love Wonder Woman was good but you could be great
Gonna copy wonder woman now😂😂😂?
It feels like more of a DC wonder woman vibe
Wow yet another movie with a badass ass kicking woman I can’t wait to not see this 🙄
Super man woman 2.0?
For those complaining about her punching an old woman, that wasn’t an old woman. It was a Skrull (shapeshifting aliens).
Stop crying because a woman is finally a lead role you feminist. You guys are acting like they never are! Wonder Woman, Tomb raider, Residents evil, Atomic Blonde, and I’m sure many more. People only separate themselves further from what they want by making the problem stand out. I shed more tears watching spongebob and Patrick dry out than anyone could’ve here...Wimps
Superwoman vs Captain Marvel what a match!
1:39 female batman confirmed
my favourite female hero is back, woooooooooow!!!!!
There is woman power
Since when has captain marvel been a woman ? I've read all marvel comics and captain marvel is a man.
Ok i don't Want to sound like a sexiest, but for the love of comics, marvel please you guys should not make this captain mavel beat tanos one on One, if thor, captain American, iron man, black panther can't beat tanos one on One even all joined against him? It would be so disappointing for a female to beat him one on one
LMFAO dude she just coldclock an old ass woman? LOOLOOL
women can't do what man can do so stop putting them in hero movies
*immediately punches old woman in the face*
She look alright she ain't no wonder women I tell you that
Can we all agree im tired of females being superheroes
I am afraid of the end result, but I feel the movie is going to be very bland and generic. This is going to be Marvel's Wonder Woman, changing tone (that's all).
What is wrong with her slapping an elderly woman in the face
This just does not excite me like the Wonder Woman Trailer...Nothing jumps out at you and Brie Larson does not command the screen like Gal Gadot did.
Finally, the first female super Saiyan to be on the big screen.
1:30 did she just punch an old woman?
I don’t like captain Marvel. Just let Thanos live his life and in the real world you wouldn’t rely on a woman to save the word because it’s too much pressure for them.
Disappointing that Captain Marvel is a female I'd rather it be a male
This will be the next Wonder Woman but actually good
Young Nick Fury, young Nick Coulson, first female mcu heroine solo movie. I'm in😎
The Star sprangled woman with a plan.
lol females thinking they're strong
Female superhero are boring.............
Just don't make it the feminist movie like marvel did ms marvel in civil war
Is Wonder Woman stronger than her ?
highkey feel like everyone is shitting on this trailer just because its a female lead but,, none of my business 🤷🏼‍♀️
The most badass female in Marvel come!!!
And stay away of this super powerful women's way
The movie looks like it'll be good, and all, but why do you spend most of the trailer for a female-led superhero movie concentrating on a male character in voice over? Compare this to DCU's Wonder Woman trailer, which starts out with Diana's voice over. We barely hear from Carol in this trailer. Maybe I'm nitpicking, but whatever.
Bad: her facial expressions. She looks bored the entire trailer. Wonder women looked like she was enjoying herself.
lmao can't wait for all the YouTube editing channels to do a 'Wonder Woman' Trailer - CAPTAIN MARVEL STYLE or Star Wars or Jurassic Park or some bollocks like that
So it's a female hmmm
She looks like female Heath Ledger
Now thatz gonna beat wonder womens ass😂😅😆😆😍
When she hit the old lady it reminded me of when Dean threatened to stab the old woman in the neck because he knew it was a shapeshifter 😂😂
A woman lead actor, what an age this is.
Now there's a female superhero. She's gonna blow Wonder Woman out of the water.
RIP wonder woman
People had the same reaction when wonder woman tariler came out and the rest you know...
Wanna know why this trailer is bad? Tell me, if you were a person who knew absolutely jack shit about captain marvel, explain to me why this blond lady from space punched an old woman straight in the face.
*Punches an elderly woman
Bruh Shazam Finna destroy this lol 😂.this movie look badder than wonderwoman saying kal l, lel
Captain marvel, punching old women from 1980s..
Can  not wait for every Left wing movie and news outlet to say it is the best ever Marvel movie......since the last best ever Marvel movie. And it is the first Female Super Hero movie ever................I won t dignify that with an answer.
lol. Worst actress. No expression. Marvel please next time pick a worthy talented actress for future solo female superhero movie. Too disappointed with trailer as well as Brie Larson. 😑😞
Why another women hero... PFTT
superman copy "superduperwoman"
Why are all the Marvel women blonde? 😓
I'm getting some serious YA vibes from this movie. Like, solo movie, moody female lead that has to regain her memories and train her powers, hunted by a greater society, led and mentored by an older male veteran, sunset filter everywhere... I dont know, man. I watch this and the divergent trailrs side by side and altjough totally different, they give me the same vibes
*Wonder Woman done right = Captain Marvel!*
1:30 Wtf I think see gonna help the old women but instead she punch him ..haahhaaa😂😂😂
why did she punch that old woman in the subway
Plot twist 1:31 is actually an old woman 😂
designed to destroy humanity. Feminism is a women's supremacy
That's looks like a female version of Green Lantern 😪🙄
WonderWomen trailer was Better
When I think of the name Captain Marvel, I just can't help but think it sounds too masculine for a woman superhero.
Typical woman
top 20 because wonder woman is female I don't say that because Captain America is male I mean the story 
Dafuq why she hit the old woman :/
Every new Disney movie is bad because of the stupid feminism. For example, I really don't care that elastagirl was the main hero in incredibles 2. That was fine. But they made her say the most feminist shit and there was actually no point. Happens in almost every movie now. I hope marvel doesn't follow that, but this girl is a major feminist. Not to mention they decided to randomly release this movie on national womens day. This movie is gonna be all about feminism smh.
wonder woman is way hotter
I don'tget all the trailer hate? just because a trailer doesn't spoil the best moments like most other marvel films do- thata actually a refreshingly good thing. This trailer seems to aim for the purpose of intruiging the audience about her STORY and isn't about the action alone and that is also refreshing, particularly as its exactly wat marvel needs to do with a character like her being only now introduced. I'll b honest its not at all what i was expecting plot wise but that just shows marvel is shaking things up- would u prefer a rehash of ironman or CATFA? No, i for one am ooking forward to it. Another things that i wasn't expecting and is yet another refreshing change of pace is that it looks to be non-linear- delving into her past with her memories distorted/scattered. People need to stop hating- if u want this movie to be bad because u dont like Brie or a female led film then shut up because just because that's your opinion doesn't mean it atuomatically will come true!
i'm so confused, why did she punch the old woman?
Captain Marvels a woman now?  Lol
Woman Power !!
The future is female, the future don't need no males.
Capt Marvel v Wonder Woman....
Just what we need another female HER O lol!
I think I'll just watch Wonder Woman 2 instead.
And battle between captain marvel and wonder woman supporters are start.......
I didn’t know much about Brie Larson until she was cast in this film. From everything that I’ve read and seen, I don’t like her as a person and won’t be going to see this movie. Then I went and spent some time learning about Captain Marvel and it’s a poorly written character shoved down the throats of comic book fans. It’s went through like 7 different relaunches because of poor sales. I enjoyed wonder woman and black panther, but I hoped Marvel hasn’t lost their minds and started going woke so they could go broke.
Discount Wonder Woman.
Isn’t her uniform the wrong color? Lol and she stole captain marvels name. Leave it to a women haha. Not feminist.
Summary: She punches some old woman on the subway and then proceeds to turn into a Halloween pumpkin
Feminists have taken control of hollywood. They ruined Star Wars, now they are ruining Marvel...
She's not as pretty as Wonder Woman.  She looks like a "Becky".
argh! she has no butt, no curves, not even a toned body like gal gadot had as wonder women. she just so generic, black widow look way better than her.
Punching old women is such a Carol Danvers thing to do though. Remember how much joy she go in the comics doing shitty things like “punishment before the crime” in Civil War 2.
We get a Marvel/Female Man of Steel that might actually be better then just decent.
1:30 Wait a minute. Was that elderly woman she just punched a skrull? If so, why didn't they include a clip of her returning to her original form?
A blonde female alien crashing on Earth in the past. Are you sure I’m not watching Doctor Who?
It's a female dominated film definitely it going to break the box office records
Is nobody gonna talk about how marvel just made their first female superhero?! Besides Gamora and Black Widow bc they didn’t get their own movies.
Whoever made this trailer needs to be fired because it looks like shit. You show her punching out an old woman? wtf? We all know that is prob some bad guy in disguise but you didn't show that so it just looks ridiculous. It feels like a parody trailer.
Old woman is the skrull?
Meh. Not sexy enough. Give me wonder woman!
They are trying to make bad copy of wonder woman
Already blows wonder woman out of the water
Eat shit Wonder Woman/Gal Gadot
Gonna beat wonder woman records 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Would guys just ignore the "Woman empowerment" bs?! I swear stuff like that ruins a great or average movie like this. People only say it is because of movies like this. People like that ruin movies and its only bad because you make it seem bad
Looks like a tv super girl "empowering woman" spin off movie but ill watch it for the end credits
Im not sure why Captain Marvel is female here. Im just gunna assume theres has been for the longest time a dispute between DC and Marvel as always.
punch old women right in the face while riding the train. that's what makes her a hero.
That woman is a skrull ... Ok what??? This is AWESOME!!!!
And the next phase of the MCU will feature forced ethnicity diversity, LGBTQ, and feminist characters.
Ah a female lead.  Unless its kill bill 3 it probably will suck
Anyone else see Wonder Woman all over this??
Could Captain Marvel be that strong female character?
Enough with super heroes... Now we desperately need more super villans even if it is a women.
The only one she attacked in this trailer was an old woman, so now they're promoting elderly abuse? great... anyway this looks BOOORING!! This is the female captain America, and it looks like a replica of his first movie which was a snore. Not impressed or enthused by this trailer all.
About time! I was getting tired of Hollywood pugging women in male roles. 
I still prefer wonder woman!
DC Universe: We have the best female hero.
Wonder Woman>Captain Marvel
Let’s hope this is better then Wonder Woman, kinda looking like a feminist take on captain America
This looks okay, the acting is gonna be great and the shield and villains look cool, but it looks boring. It kinda looks like green lantern just with a women main character and more of a boring story.
She looks soooo good in the suit, they really picked the right woman for the role, all those curves are just ugh😍
Men, with all due respect, grow the hell up. I for one am excited to see this film and loved what I have seen so far. It gave me just enough to be excited without giving anything in terms of spoilers not to mention this film stands out as a different kind of MCU film and not just because it’s a solo female led film. The past few films have all clearly shown to be very genre driven and this film continues that trend.
No one beats Gal Gadot in being the superwoman ...marvel should have had her first.. for this role
Trailer says a hero followed by captain marvel punching an old woman
Some people are saying captain marvel is a male. I thought she was always female. But i say the cast and there is a male and a female captain marvel.
it's going to be feminist shit
wonder woman > this
This is true women empowerment...........💪💪
Womens day, really? REALLY? A spit in the face of women doing real struggle in society.
Women -> A Hero ?
Who's ready for another movie to be ruined due to everyone putting pressure on the studios to make it an empowering female character so much to the point that they make her a feminist wet dream token so much so that it loses all sense of humanity and a legitimate strong female character...
Please don't go victim mode marvel we know she's a female you don't need to put it in big bright words.
Some of you should just go ahead and admit you dont like women
Talk about trying to show of equality there biggest character is a women
Hmm I think the Wonder woman trailer was better
Like if you’re excited for 2019! Star Wars 9, Avengers 4, Captain Marvel, Spider-Man 2, Shazam! Wonder Woman 1984, Godzilla 2, The Joker, Glass, Toy Story 4, Dark Phoenix, IT Chapter 2, The LEGO Movie 2, Dumbo, MIB, Aladdin, The Lion King, Bond 25, How To Train Your Dragon 2, Jungle Cruise, this gon be a hell of a year! Not to mention Netflix shows returning like Stranger Things 3, and much more!
I remember when Wonder Woman's first trailer was out, people were saying that Gal must be real bad since she didn't say much in the trailer. Interesting...
OK. Here r my thoughts. I thought this was a pretty solid trailer. My biggest concern though-just getting this out of the way-is Brie Larson's bland expression throughout a good chunk of this. Damnit woman, you are an oscar winner. ACT!!! Hopefully this is just part of her character for maybe the first act of the story, and they are going with a fish out of water approach. I'm staying optimistic about this. 
Movie with a forced female lead, boring and stale.
wonder woman. superman and lara croft marvel edition
Seriously!  How can marvel and disney think that she will going to replace rdj or chirs evans as next leader of Avengers. The trailer looks really crap and Only a feminist can get enjoy such type of movie
It is not very nice to teach women to hit their grandmas.
Very underwelming trailer. The music is way off, it doesn't connect with the visuals. So far I am not interested. Since the comparison is going to be made, Wonder Woman had a way better trailer.
She sounds more girlish than a woman soldier if that make since but other than that, movie looks good.
Powerful women!! Yes!
Why so many dislikes? Some women hating folks in the vicinity me thinks
Worst trailer I've ever seen because the protagonist is a girl. Feminist power sucks.
Wonder Woman in the current DC films shows female superheros can be compelling and badass, but Brie Larson is not doing it for me.
Whether she’s a woman or not doesn’t matter. Marvel has fans because of the good quality movies it makes, not because they cast women . Movie needs to come first
Does punching an old woman in the face makes captain marvel marvellous?
*punches an old woman in the face*
i've said it before and i will say it again. This woman is to OP!!!
HOLY! Well I’m excited, although I do wish the first female based movie was Natasha or Peggy...
Marvel going to same mistake like DC. DC make Wonder Woman and destroy all universe Marvel make Captain Marvel and destroy all MCu
YES! Woman in space war with superpowers adventure epic! I NEED THIS
I really hope this won’t be like BP or WW where everyone is going just bc it’s a woman
So I guess Mar-Vell doesn't matter anymore and we need to give all the main roles to women and minorities. Now I know why I stopped watching Hollywood blockbusters. PC.
Better than Wonder Woman already
I already saw wonder woman
Marvel decided to tackle the villian problem by making it an old woman at 1:30 HAHAHA
Not sure I agree with bringing in Marvel's top 100 chraracters, hated of all time, will add anything to Avengers 4. And I swear if Marvel adds another character to come in and save everything.. just because she is female... I'll never have the same regard for Marvel again.
Though Infinity Wars was awesome, the closing scene where they introduced Captain Marvel has almost ruined it for me. That was a pathetic and cheap way to bring in another character, Disney. Also, this B-movie acting and clip makes me not want to see this or the next Avengers movie, especially if this character is in it.  It would have been satisfying to see the Avengers, as they stood, overcome instead of relying on some hail Mary pass so that Disney can have another female hero making them more money. Lame.
-she hits an old woman-
Billy Batson says the magic word "Shazam!" and transforms into a sullen, taciturn woman.
Better than the Wonderwoman 1984 movie.
What makes "Her".... You never see male movies where it says what makes "Him" a hero. They had to clarify that it was a woman and not a transgender or gender fluid human being so that's something good because I thought that Brie Larson was a man.
So many trashing this trailer because it features a female lead superhero. 
When you have every race group interested in your movies, but still need to get a bigger female/ feminist audience.
Nothing says superhero like punching an old woman in the face.
THANOS, hope you are ready cause this BADASS Woman is coming for you !!!
Wonder Woman: Looks like I’m the most powerful female superhero ever.
I think they changed her origin to coming from space instead of getting the disease from the original Captain Marvel just for a little fist bump from the feminists
Wonder Woman > Capt Marvel
Bunch of feminist! Can’t wait till it breaks box office records
Meh... As long as it's not a steaming pile of garbage like Wonder Woman. (That everyone gave tremendous slack to also it was DCU so it just looked less bad by comparison.) Frankly, looks like a better actress than Gadot. Seems kind've dark and serious though...
why make women like hero , is not cool
Glad she's got some normal hair. Not every female protagonist needs to look like a lesbian to be strong. 👌
Im a bad person. I cant get into any action/adventure/superhero movie with a female as the lead role.
its the rise of the feminist agenda woohaa
Both Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel are awesome! Do you agree?
Another woman empowerment documentary with Superman cloned effects! And with Nick Fury too! :P
Strongest Female hero ever
Finally a wonder woman unafraid to punch an old lady
Women is weak gender than men. Marvel should take care about it. I hope they don't choose a weaker section as HERO.
"The future is female"
maybe there's a second trailer, just to explain why the old woman punches
Super man female version
I will never fully understand all the hatred. It’s just a frigging movie. Who the f*** cares if it has a female lead?!
When Marvel makes a better Superman, Green Lantern and Wonder Woman all in one movie.
Why she punch an old woman...???
To me it's like Supergirl, Wonder Women, And Green Lantern merged into one movie. Not saying its bad just commenting.
Captain Marvel is a Mann Not Women ! 
Is no one gonna point out that Captain Marvel just punched an old woman?
I am glad Captain Marvel is still a slim blonde and they did not turn her into a *obese* Muslim woman... although I wish her costume would be the one she worn in Miss Marvel 1 (from 1977).
I hope she was just delusional and actually punched an old woman in the face.    I'm guessing it will be a Skrull or Doctor Minerva but oh well one can hope.
Nice... But will it be better than Wonder Woman? >w>
The women who gets hit is a scrull who is a shape-shifting alien. I think this movie is going to be abouy kree vs scrulls and captain marvels part in ending the war
Dafuq why is female
Since all these low self esteem lil kids can’t take a female being stronger than most of the hero’s in the mcu besides Thor then don’t watch Avengers 4 cause she will be in that movie too
I loved the part when she punches an old woman
I Think Because The Grandma Say "Wonder Woman" And The Punch
Wonder Woman sequel looks good
Why she punched the old woman?
Isn't heroine since she's female not hero?
Movie's not out yet, but she's already better than Wonder Woman.
No, its a woman!!
In before all the anti feminists start moaning about Marvel's feminist agenda lol.
God it’s getting boring. All these movies showing little skinny women, and somehow injected with super testosterone, in a futile effort to be as strong and tough as a man.....Gimme a break.
A warning to all Wonder Woman loyalists at 1:30...
My dislike just because they cast Brie Larson as Miss Marvel their are numerous female actresses who can make that character their own like how RDJ didn't just acted as Tony Stark but became one similarly Hugh Jackman for Wolverine and Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Chris Evans as Captain America.
Nothing about the character seems interesting in this trailer, in fact it seems very generic. I really hope I am wrong and that the movie itself is great. If they can stop with the feminist marketing and focus on making a great character, then this would really be comparable to wonder woman.
She punched that old woman cuz it’s a skrull in disguise
*_...where's STEM... and those eyes that blaze at adversaries, vaporizing men and, women— that's such a 'Concentration Camp' (female-takeover) sexploitation meme from the '40's..._*
Poor old woman
I think this will be better then wonder woman, shes not an isreali with broken english, sorry but dcs wonder woman doesnt do it for me
😲😲😲cap marvel mini xerox of wonderwomen 😶
I am tired of "badass female characters." Normally I'm fine with it when it's not a "female version" of a male character. It's a female character, so what's my problem this time? They pick women who don't look or sound the part... at all... and by sound, I don't mean the usual sarcastic and bitchy attitude that we almost always get, but someone who actually talks without sounding like they are borderlining crying. Plenty of male characters have this problem too nowadays.
She seems fitting for the character, it's just gonna be a buzzkill to hear all the feminist bullshit thrown all over the place like this will be the first goddamn movie with a female lead ever in the history of cinema.
The movie looks pretty cool from this trailer. If this movie is handled properly in the same way that "WonderWoman" was then it will be good. Just please no feminist propaganda bullshit.
When I heard Brie Larson is going to be Captain Marvel, I wasn't sure if she could pull it off. I am not saying she isn't a good actor. But sometimes talented actors can't pull off a simple character. I am sorry that I am going to compare this with Wonder woman/ Gal Gadot.
They tried too hard to make it look like Wonder Woman!!!
Wonder woman would kick her ass
This movie is gonna make everyone forget about Wonder Woman.
The marvel cinematic universe fandom never had a problem with women power until the dregs of the failed DCEU abandoned ship to crash our party.....
This is gonna be hot like wonder women
If they put her in her old Ms Marvel outfit, I'll bet it would double the box office.  That outfit is basically just a harsher version of the Cathy Lee Crosby Wonder Woman outfit from the seventies (Google it if you don't know the reference).
Blonde Wonder Woman
She looks just like superman but in women version and she's look powerful. Amazinggggg!!
Wonderwoman 84 > Capitana Marvel 😂😂😂😂😂
I don’t like her in the role at all. She doesn’t look strong 💪🏻 at all... this role would have suited the likes of Stana Katic or Angelina Jolie... women who look like they can kick ass... she looks like a barbie doll even her voice ! I wasn’t happy with the casting but now after the trailer I’m sooo disappointed !
The sad thing is if this movie doesn't do well, feminist will attack the reviewers and people who didn't like the film. Saying that the only people that disliked the movie were men. Lol not bringing to thought that maybe, just maybe, it was a bad film. But I hope it's a great film and it does well so we can avoid it. Cause in both scenarios feminist win so.
I bet the19k dislikes are because Captain Marvel is a Women
Movie for crazy drunk feminists.
7)Why the hell she punched that old woman ?🤔
Definitely this movie crush Wonder Woman. Marvel Rockksss
Just because she is a woman and will make the biggest responsibility in Avengers 4, you all hate on her? Say you not hype about this, let the director not to put her very powerful in Avengers because her movie is flop? Butt at the end of the day you will watch this because this movie is a part of Avengers 4. If you not watch this movie, you all miss part of Avengers 4.
Now it's looks like Wonderwoman movie is better than Captain M.
Feminist "WE NEED WOMEN IN MOVIES" everyone else "we have plenty of women that star in there own movies" feminist "not in Marvel" fantastic so let's force down a female superhero that no one cares about and make her the most powerful thing in the MCU because "female is future" and let's also get a self proclaimed feminist to star as said female superhero
This will make 8 figures surely. I mean it has it all...Female superhero in the lead..spice of the moment,  Fans eager after Infinity war to know what is next......nothing makes more money than this period,  The pre Avengers 4 movies.....as it will explain  bit what comes next, it is a Marvel movie..... and the worst of them only made about 400m all in all. If WW of DC made 800m , this will make 1.5 Bn easily when it ends its run with DVD BR and don't forget toy sales.
I hope we can all just shut up and enjoy this movie instead of feminists trying to make a big deal about this movie.
"Her" turning into "a HERo"... how feminist. ^^;
Wonder Woman watching this trailer: So that’s all you have to offer ?
Why is it that there making more movies with overpowered women in it? Like besides this one there are movie's out there where the girl hits the dude and he's down. Now, if it were real the dude would have stood up and knocked the b**** out. Am I right or am I right?
Wonder Woman Ripoff
I really hope they don't constantly focus on her being a woman in this film. Just be a superhero.
Wonder woman or Captain Marble?
A Woman is going to save the World in a movie? About time!
1:28 really have to emphasize that some people are women
Marvels own wonder woman. Looks LIT
Your trailer really has nothing to do with it. It sucks. Look at the Wonder woman. Although the plot isn't so ideal, at least it's fun to predict, can you respect art?
What's with the whole "Smile More" thing? She's fighting a war-no one's going to be all smiles when they're fighting. Frankly, Brie Larson looks absolutely bad-ass in this role, and trailer makes the movie seem intense and engaging. Let's hope that pans out. I love strong female characters and I will be thrilled if Captain Marvel turns out to be one in the movies
I dont think it'll be good as wonder woman if it's a feminist kind of movie.
Female superheros are trash, fight me
liked for slapping an old woman. that's hillarious
@MARVEL what's up with making such a boring trailer for a movie about a female character? And one this important at that. Female superheroes are a rarity which is why I will watch it but this trailer doesn't inspire anyone to watch, it's boring, generic, lacks everything that would make you want to watch. I really hope the movie isn't anything like the trailer. Godammit, Marvel.
Punches an old woman - 'i need to see this movie now.'
CAPTAIN MARVEL//CAROL DANVERS))>one badass female superhero
Marvel tryna play a DC on us releasing their own Wonder Woman
I thought its a wonder Woman Trailer
captain marvel is female why??
The problem with comic books and the characters that have spawned from them is that they revolve around masculine seance of a hero figure, even while using a women she must conform to a patriarchal role to fulfill a social construct in the avid comic book fan boy's mind of who a hero is, this is problematic and must be changed to further the cause of empowered women who are oppressed under the tyrannical capitalism driven corporations who profit off not only abusing women but using the masculine urges that have been normalized by society.
When Marvel Shows Captain Marvel Puching An Elderly Woman And Now Its A  Meme On The Comment Section..
marvel superwoman lmao
Now it's time to just sit back and wait for all the feminists to start bitching about her being to beautiful and having shaved arm pits .. Oh what a time to be alive  :)
I hope this isn’t a very political, feminist type movie. That would suck the fun out of everything and make it very awkward to watch. I hope it’s like Wonder Women.
Mmmmm is not for be male chauvinist but i never like movies about Hero female like a protagonist, its boring but i only see to follow the line of marvel movies
The emotional tone in this is nice and fresh. A woman out of place and time, not knowing her past and herself. Nicely paralleled by the editing too. Exciting trailer!
Ok, hear me out cause there is just one thing to say... Hopes and prayers for Wonder Woman.
The Marvel version of Wonder Woman
Please don't screw this up marvel PLEASE!!!!! Ps: But I still believe in you marvel Inshallah I'll be able to enjoy a well directed, Perfectly Acted, Profesionally edited, female led superhero movie with my mother
Because beating old ladies who may or may not be Skrulls is just the thing to put her over Wonder Woman...that and they gave her that stupid helmet to boot.
Did she just hit the old woman?😂😂😂😂
In this era of strong female athletes ALL OVER YOUTUBE they couldn't find 1 women who looks like she can do 5 push ups???!!! She looks like a prepubescent boy. I wouldn't pick her out of a line up for a kickball team never mind the AVENGERS!
Weakest marvel trailer I think I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for womens rights and equal right but put some effort into the trailer.
it comes out on women's independence day :) (just like jessica jones' series)
Looked kinda boring... Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is ten times more exciting and ravishing to watch..!!
Captain marvel most powerful female super hero in mcu
Oh here we go.  Superman powers with Wonder Woman.  Never did like Superman...
She's such a feminist! Lol
Nah, going to watch Shazam instead. Wonder Woman's trailer was better and her movie was great.
This looks terrible. Her acting is shite. She is in no way intimidating or cool. Compare her to every other marvel hero in the avengers and she is by far the worst. I've seen most marvel films in the cinema but i am definitely not paying for this shite. This film is going to do badly and Marvel deserves it for bowing down to the feminists.
Everyone should know that Marvel started filming this in inspiration to the "Gender Equality" movement as it takes more than a year to film, but the movement has gone quiet in the media since then and the release of this came too late to be relevant. Look at the description - "Higher, Further, Faster." In addition, this would be the first female character to get her own Marvel Cinematic Universe movie. Don't get me wrong, women ARE better then men and need to be treated equal. I am just referring to the exposed money manipulation Marvel is taking to maintain being relevant to high profile issues such as gender equality.
Women cant drive
I am not used to this much protagonist in my female characters....Quick, make her punch an old lady so I know who the real hero is.
RIP the old woman
Looks like :-)   Marvel wonder women
For anyone that doesn’t know, captain marvel is played by a trans woman.
A female version(not really)of One Punch Man? Hell yeah :p We need him to stop Thanos
That woman playing Captain Marvel looks so wrong.
Oh great another *women power* movie... not watching it
Oh man, gotta have a strong independent female that can beat Thanos because Tony, Steve and thor are beta males compared to a strong independent female. 
Did she just punch an old woman in the face
looks boring. women superheroes should not be a thing.
Gosh forget about my opinion now, because as a female myself I’ve seen people say stuff about feminism and etc, like honestly I don’t even want to share my opinion like it’s not like someone hates woman, because I’m a girl myself but I just feel like she Came so randomly and now she’s more powerful than Thor which is sorta sad because you know, 10 years down the drain, don’t even comment saying stuff about feminist and etc, like get a life it’s my opinion and I have a slight bad feeling if she kills thanos herself like seriously I will die if she does like tbh if she helps with the avengers but like tony or someone is mainly the one to kill thanos, then that’s fine with me, but I’m a girl myself so what the hell are you saying “oh etcetctctetc” with your talking, like I literally don’t give a crap.
Captain marvel is male, not female. Also, women aren't warriors, so stop depicting them as such.
can't wait for the butthurt comments about evil feminist propaganda
But still better that whatever the crap that was wonder woman!
Did she really just punch an old woman in the face.
I was afraid this movie would be some sort of girlpower feminist propaganda trash. This trailer made me more optimistic, I'm glad.
The feminists are taking over
Yapımcı feminist galiba
Lame. More garbage university brainwashed feminists can live vicariously through, until a desire for another cat hits them 2 months later. Then they need another band tattoo to hide their pain.
Every other female character was good in the MCU but for captain marvel I just feel they went from making a heroine film to just straight up feminism
I read that a lot of people think her voice doesn't fit to Captain Marvel. But guys it's not a voice that makes a man or a woman strong, but their actions and in this case also their powers
Very underwhelming, the first Wonder Woman trailer was waaayyyy better!
Unlike Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel has a body armor which *ACTUALLY COVERS HER WHOLE BODY*
Wonder woman was better. Her helmet looks like Batman in bvs though. But I'm still gonna watch the movie.
Soooooooo... Female Thor?  Thanks but no thanks.  I'll be over here enjoying my hero acedamia with characters that aren't a snooze fest.
Isn’t this supposed to be a teaser trailer? I understand why people are underwhelmed, but this is a completely new character. Yes, Doctor Strange was too. However, Marvel has to be careful of their marketing of the movie in light of its main character being female instead of male compared to every other Marvel movie. I’m excited for the next trailer and the movie itself.
Wonder woman would beat her any day
I don’t see why people think this movie is about feminism, it’s not, with the Wonder Woman trailer, you could tell right off the bat it was feminisms, this one isn’t
Feminism evolution after Wonder Woman
Wonder Woman 2.0
THIS IS GONNA BE THE SHIT. she was the first hero and therefore the best. Cause women always do it better
So far (for the last decade) marvel have managed to create blockbusters that make billions without offending or attacking any ideals or beliefs. The movies have been fun and emotional with strong men and women actors (peggy Carter anyone?). I am genuinely afraid that marvel is going to start virtue signaling and play identity politics and this will kill the mcu (look at solo). Please marvel keep it fun and successful. Remember your core audience only cares if the movie has a strong woman character if you rub their noses in it.
Just like Rey Captain Marvel shows up overpowered and gets everything handed to her because she's a woman.
People judging a movie from a 2 minute trailer and a woman from 4 lines are so weak lmao
Women power chick flick
She slapped a old woman 
The trailer was not good. The story seems boring and not believable. Ill go with Wonder Woman 1984
This is all brain washed and twisted . Why would Captain Marvel be a woman and why not a man . Not that it's a issue cause in reality we all know the outcome to heroism . Fantasy which blond is gonna save your grand parents a man not to mention a female bystander . Despite the plot and total story the movie will not follow through like your average Wonder woman story . This is Captain Marvel Supermans close rival in DC and they are gonna ruin it with feminism . Imagine how cornie it's gonna sound when they explain this power she came to harness .TOTAL FLOPPP
The feminists are taking over!!!!!
Why does it have to be a woman?
Already the greatest woman superhero next to Wonder Woman and doesn't even have a movie out yet
The only hero well ever get from a woman..... Is Bruce Jenner
So who wanted to copy each other first, DC or Marvel? Let's set a lead female charcter movie in the mid80s and/late90s.
Old granny: Hey, are you wonder woman
Remember this begin's the age of bowing to women. BOW TO WOMENN!!!!!
God that looks freaking stupid. That lady has one facial expression and the charisma of a potato.  This looks like they needed a "women are everything" movie where this potato actress is like indestructible magic lady. Girl power and all that jazz. 
Captain Marvel is released on March 8, 2019, exactly on International Women’s Day. Wow, well played Marvel!
So, basically Wonder Woman in space?!
In the comics, Black Panther gets the infinity gems.... I hope this leads to that and not some BS "only a woman can save the world" agenda. Storm would whoop that ass by the way....
For those wondering why Captain Marvel punched an old woman it's because that woman was most likely a Skrull
Wonder woman movie doodooo
When did Shazam became female?
wow badass women is where it's at 👌👌
Comment section is proof that the standard of proof for women is automatically raised higher than it would be for men.
I see a woman trying to act like a man.....
First of all, why Brie? Yes she has an Oscar caliber of acting, but she's not a super hero type of girl. Why not Charlize Theron or Kate Beckinsale, Sienna Miller, Natalie Dormer or any other actresses who has a wild side (Kate "Hella" Blancet and Scarlett "Widow" for the example), bad girl but also smooth inside, wise, reckless and charismatic. It's more like the woman's version of Stark. Not the techie things, but the character. 
Why did she hit that old woman?😂😂😂
ME: oh this is the first female leading movie in the mcu. And it has pre guardians korath and ronan, as well as phil coulson coming back to the mcu.
Glad Hollywood is giving women and minorities better roles. This isn't a debate ,I'm just saying 
I like the part where it says "discover what makes a hero" and then shows her punching a seated old woman.
Can't beat wonder women theme, i expected more from marvel ..... Failed
I want to see this Captain Marvel woman like start glowing at WW, like what's she gonna do, glow? THIS SUCKS  (Disney)
-ok what do we do with female characters?
32 million views in 3 days? RESPECT!  Plus who doesn't appreciate a woman who will give grandma love tap?
Cap marvel would destroy wonder woman...
white empowered women,black dominant male character, another poc sidekick,over the edge 4th wave warped feminizm yo, whats not to like my dear goyim.I am so done with the whole entertainment industry.
So basically she's only interesting because she's a woman.  Gotcha, Marvel.  Very subtle.
Tryin' to get some of that Wonder Woman money.
Omg smh we know she's a female! This is getting ridiculous! Her gender is irrelevant. I know some special snowflake must’ve cut this trailer. I hope this movie doesn’t do as well as other Marvel flicks just to show these idiots not everyone is down with their agenda.
This alien Feminist is soooo different!
This gotta be the least hot Marvel female character ever to show up in a marvel universe. But maybe marvel is not about attractiveness at all but rather "if she who lives the next door can be a super hero, so can I!"
This might sound racist but I usually don't find white women attractive, but something about this woman playing captain marvel I just cant take my eyes off her my goodness she is beautiful.
"During Women's History Month 2019..."
- Wonder Woman 1984 (November 2019)
Gonna be wack because she's a woman
Now I’m interested even more in this movie just to figure out why captain marvel hit a old women
Meh... The movie looks lame. If her acting is anything like how she's portrayed in the trailer this movie is going to suck. She's not interesting at all. She's just so plain. Marvel should have taken notes from the Wonder Woman film.
Waaaaaaay better than wonder woman! *please insert hate comments*
I know she gets every tough female role these days but Charlize Theron would've been a better Captain Marvel. Brie's voice just isn't superhero quality.
Not for me! No thanks Marvel! Another attempt from disney to do women powerfull! This so boring!
I liked it. As a woman, I just hope there won't have the girl power bs. Just let her be a badass because she is badass and not a woman. By the way, Will Mar-Vell and Tony Stark cross paths? THAT would be funny.
Not interesting whatsoever. Another wonder woman.
Okay, we don't need Fem-a-Nazi's telling us "This is what we fought for" because us Men have been fighting this fight before it was cool for women to like Nerd Crap. So, shut up and sit down.
i hope this movie is isn't feminist propaganda because it looks good
So this is Marvel's next trick? A female superhero?
RIP Wonderwoman
The only criticism of this trailer that I have is the fact that the scene in which she punches the old lady was cut terribly. The camera angle should’ve covered the gap between her fist and her face. Yet, the cameraman left that wide open and you can now see the gaping punch. Either way, the cameraman should’ve helped cover the gap or Brie should’ve brought the punch closer to the woman’s face. 
A marvel movie about a woman? The feminists are taking over!
is this Wonder Woman?
Feminists will love this movie!
I don’t think a girl should be the savior of the marvel universe(which seems like the case) no sexist reasoning it’s just weird, wonder women works in DC but this feels weird, like for example if it wasn’t a girl and a strong man who can take on fights without powers on the trailer it would be better not by much tho but better
"a hero"... proceed to punch old woman
This looks good! I’m so glad that Marvel is making a female superhero movie!! 😁
I don't know anything about Captain Marvel, but this trailer looks like the movie will take place in the past (Nick Fury), tries to replicate the origin of Superman and the tone of Wonder Woman. And the description sounds like it already is a sequel. Over all I'm skeptical.
Female main character in a big budget movie
'Wonder Woman' was pretty good, even if some of the dialogue was cringe-worthy. I really hope they don't just make all the men look like morons in this movie while shouting "Girl Power!" -_-
Women are NOT tough like men. This movie like most portrays women in an unhealthy and DELUSIONAL way. Turns women into lesbians. Just like pencil thin models, movies like these should also be shamed
captain marvel is a woman ,
The female Green Lantern?
feministas unite!
All the men crying in the comments are funny af. They hate female characters when they aren't oversexualized and they can't fap to them xD
Love marvel way more than dc but this ain't no wonder woman
Oof this movie about to be better than Wonder Woman 💯👍🏽
she punches a old woman? omg
Hope She is not female version of Green lantern and ruin avengers.
CAPTAIN???  Marvel is a woman??  LOL.  Rip marvel
I hope the second trailer would be good and look just be glad we get a female in a Marvel film just like DC did with Wonder Woman
The feminist are taking over
are we just going to breeze past the fact that she punched an elderly woman on the bus?
The real question is, will this finally be enough to shut the feminists up?
A new female super hero... like what powers the she e even  have
disgusting feminist crap
Wow this is trailer amazingly has more likes than dislikes. A B-listed character that comes out of nowhere with no platform, no, teasers no, Easter eggs and no references to 10 years of the MCU no nothing just the overpowered Ms. Marvel who is strangely now the face of the MCU and is going to defeat Thanos alone thank you for reminding me that we actually care about a character we don't, no one in theaters was excited for this character more than half thought was Wonder Woman lol.
Ah, a leftist feminist propaganda film. Communistic in its roots to “empower” women and destroy western society even more.
This trailer looks great, I'm really excited. I'll be honest, I was a little concerned given the current climate in the entertainment industry: push female and non white characters in promotions so when the movie gets criticized you can pull some cheap shots and label all fans as bigots. The comic books don't have much good source material for this character, but given the past ten years of interesting varied characters crafted and presented by the MCU I do trust the creative leads on this one
Huge CGI power-up. Just like Thor. And Wonder Woman. And Thanos. And the other Captain Marvel.
But of course a feminist is now the new face of the MCU and the most powerful character ever in the MCU.
she just punch old woman , she dont deserve to be captain marvel ,  but savage marvel 😂
In a world where dead pan superheroes played by hack actors further the feminist agenda.
The ultimate lesbian is a man which can think like a woman.
Great job Warner Bro. You nailed the Female Green Lantern.
People complaining in the comment section makes me disappointed, in my opinion this is one of the BEST marvel trailers they've made, not many marvel trailers have made me hyped, but this one certainly did. Seeing Nick with hair, AND two eyes, seeing the blockbuster gave me immense nostalgia, and not to mention that this is the MCUs first female superhero movie. I think that's some exciting shit regardless of what the intentions were. Not to mention seeing someone bitchslap an old lady is a rare sight in a movie, but not an unwelcome one.
Why did Captain Marvel punch that poor old woman into the face??
Its pathetic how people will hate on this movie just for the fact it has a female lead. Grow tf up.
Captain Marvel : (Punches a sweet smiling old woman right in the face)
1 woman more powerful than all the make hero's....I can hear feminists dripping already
It's cool that the female Marvel is getting more attention, but I miss the lightning bolt and cape.
Meh, nothing like Wonder Woman, not even close.
Even as a man, all the unjustified hate towards this movie makes me get a super good glimpse into the life of a woman. Short glimpse, but very clear. Damn guys, honestly it's less than two minutes and this woman is already getting hate for basically existing at this point. Trash movie? IT'S NOT EVEN OUT YET HOW DO YOU KNOW???
Before some fanboys decide to jump the shark, I'm going to write what I wrote before they released Black Panther.  This is a super hero movie.  Not a feminist movie (or a Black movie).  It's a movie movie.  Keep the judgments to a minimum until the next trailer at least.  Secondly, this is the first official trailer.  Treat it as the teaser that it actually is.  It's not going to look awesome (although, it kinda does) Thirdly, she punched a grandma (and if you didn't know it already, there are Skrulls in this movie, look that stuff up), so best believe she has no problems punching anyone, male or female. Finally, this is a Marvel movie.  They tend not to suck, so prepare to be pleasantly surprised.  Unless, of course, you are a DC hater.  Henry Cavill has proved that he is not the problem....
Listen Wonder Women is cool but did she hit a grandma? I DONT THINK SO
Thor goddammit 😩😩,you could have just aimed for the head and we would have never needed an overpowered Avengers with a feminist portraying it...
Just say you're mad that the strongest hero is a female and go
I'll save you from reading the comments because majority of them are AIDS infested cancer. People talking about the old lady getting hit, feminists, people so unoriginal they have to describe a meme and how it relates to the movie, a bunch of "wow 1 million like" comments, a few comments of "hey alien invasion and of course it happens only in the USA, and bunch of hate for the movie. You're welcome.
Dude this woman has no expression. I’m sure this movie will be enjoyable but goddamn I’ve been calling it since day one that they should’ve casted better
women arent pilots
We respec women
Basically just a backstory and another "don't underestimate me because I'm a woman" shit
1:40 batwoman ??????????????????????????????
I'm ganna jack off to this movie just like wonderwoman
"Woman woman woman woman woman woman woman woman Woman woman woman woman woman woman woman woman Woman woman woman woman woman woman woman woman" attitude isn't carried over into the movie, but judging by a few moments from this trailer and the directors, I'm gonna say it is. If reviews aren't good, definitely not seeing this one.
*why did i have no reaction to the elderly woman getting punched but i quaked & gasped when phil showed up*
Everyboday say DC movies are dark, well I just saw a super hero hitting an old woman...😶
The person to save the world from Thanos just punched an old woman...
Wonder Woman better watch out
Can we swap her for Wonder Woman!
Well hopes it's the story of a hero who happens to be a women and not the story of a women who happens on being a hero.
Oh wait thats a Marvel movie? Theres no way this boring uninspired low budget knockoff green lantern sequel is the next marvel movie. Just stahp! And brie larson? The woman who has less expression than a block of wood?
Now all I have to do is sit back and watch all the white knights complain about how the main character is a female and it’s promoting empowerment despite it being  canon.
1:31 When you were eyeing that last seat on the bus, but the snarky old woman takes it and just smiles at you.
This will be marvel 1st L ,trying to play the strong women empowerment movie
mmmm am I the only one who feels like they definitely could’ve cast a better female actress in this role? Maybe even an unknown up and coming actress? Bri Larson just looks so off. She’s not an action hero and (I know imma get shit for this) isn’t built like one either. The folks at Marvel made Paul Rudd work to get a six pack n he’s pushing 50, hell they made Chris Pratt completely flip his life around from being borderline obese to a muscle beast annnnnd Bri doesn’t even look like she jogged for this role. Kind of a let down. Aside from physicality people just don’t embody an action hero, and she’s one of them. You can’t make an actress be good at playing action hero by slapping a dumbass costume on them, they have to actually fit. Just like Steve Buscemi was never cast for a superhero role, neither should Bri Larson have.
Give that woman an Oscar NOW!!!
Old woman is evil so she punches the old woman?
I eagerly waited for women centric film from marvel like wonder woman.
She is so insipid. What a wrong selection for the main character. It is unusual to see Marvel choosing people that don´t represent the character at all. It reminds me to Valkyrie, from a tall and blonde nordic female character in the comics to a black and small female character from the Bronx in the movies. By the way, it seems to be a fan made trailer.
When you hv a male dominant movie, you hear feminist speaking against the movie producers about gender inequality. When you see a female dominant movie, do you hear any masculinist speaking against the producers? Nah! We bruhs are happy with any movie regardless of gender or racial casting. We don waste time complaining over small issues. We go for the storyline, acting skills, cgi, all tht good stuff which makes a movie great!
I'm surprised at the comments...I'm not a huge woman superhero fan...but it looked good to me.
Watch out! Its Captain Feminist!
but this isn't as appealing as  wonder woman
Yassss one of my fav female superheros are given a movie!❤
She's punching an elder woman. I'm sold
The strongest hero is a woman? Seriously?
bet this will be shit.wonder woman is far better and better casting
I bet money if I go see this there's gonna be nothing but feminist in the theaters
everyone butt hurt about this trailer is just mad because we’re finally getting a woman superhero movie from marvel. just say you’re sexist and go
Don't look like cap marvel in the comics at all. Is marvel scared to have a blonde short haired women. Not interested in the kree skrull war either.
Did captain marvel punch a old women 
Ah this looks stupid. Plus in my opinion the chicks voice doesn’t have that marvel factor to it like the other female actors in the movies. Not excited for this one really. Now y’all don’t get butt hurt because the trailer didn’t get me amped for this CGI fest
But, yeah. Because of the russian roulette feeling I get whenever theres a female lead in a hollywood movie / project in recent years, im gonna pass on this movie.
Great... another woman superhero movie. Yawn.
When someone wont give up their seat for the pregnant woman.
Another boring women hero. Where are these women in real life ?
All this political correctness is ruining movies.  First the failed all female “Ghostbusters” then the failed all female “Oceans 8” this stuff is just getting ridiculous.
it hurts me that the first film of a female superhero was not the black widow :(
She punched an old woman...rude... probably a skrull
Wonder Woman-ripoff
I was starting to get quite upset and cry until I saw a black woman had been included. Diversity - what a joke.
Correct me if I'm wrong but I do believe this is a first female Marvel film 🤔
This is miles better than that shitty ass Wonder Woman move 💫💦💫
*plz dont hurt the most powerful female charecter in mcu
Nice try Marvel. You can make all the Female lead movies you want. But you can't erase Elektra being your first.
1:30 That villainous old woman looks to be more sinister than Thanos, good to see justice in action
I legit have dreams about a female character that’s base exactly like her. I only knew her name from Infinity War but I didn’t expect her character to be so badass! Can’t wait for this movie!
Feminism destroys femininity in women and replaces it with
Plays clip of punching an old women.
It's too pretentious. HERo. OK, I get it, she is a woman. So fresh, great, never seen woman-superhero before, wow. Wow...WW..
Typical feminist bulshit. Smh 🤦‍♂️ can’t they came with any other word other than “We have no idea what we’re dealing with” ?? 😒
Captain Marvel vs. Wonder Woman
Thumbs down because the lead role is a feminist 😂 sorry marvel but I’m skipping this movie
Fake captain marvel,more like captain feminist,lol.Shazam is the real captain marvel,btw this trailer looks meh.
Captain marvel is not a woman. He's a man.
For Wonder Woman
Either way. Dc for females ... mcu for male ... cause their always so stupid
Dc: *releases Wonder Woman*
1:30 - 1:31 punching that old woman was ruthless lol.
Total emersion break making the character a female.
this will fail at the box office everything is wrong first of captain marvel is not a woman its a guy the director dosent go by the comic books
Confirmed: God is a woman
Well feminists are trying to take away Father's Day why not Captain Marvel? Hell let's make Batman female to why not. And let's throw a male Poison Ivy in Just for kicks.
Captain Marvel was a black woman (Monica Rambeau) before she was a white woman. She was even leader of the avengers. That was groundbreaking and then Marvel comics ended that in the worst way by injuring Monica.
Oh my gosh nick fury is so adorable young and this looks so...so awsome, let’s hope this woman can punch thanos in the head instead of the old woman.
I prefer a bored female lead than a strong one. Don't @ me
Punching an old woman, some hero..............*sarcasm*
Can we start doing male superheroes again? Female superheroes just don't feel convincing
Not as feminist as I thought
I put the major fan dislike of this trailer down to 2 things. 1, the studio has been overhyping this for years. That’s not that good if this movie is looking to be at a smaller scale than infinity war. And 2, the lack of context. Sure we got some but not enough to satisfy our interest. I can see why they did this since the ant man trailers gave everything away. Also there could a third one if you count the gurrr me hate feminists all gurls ar feminists factor.
Okay can anyone explain to me which part of the trailer is so terrible that you ppl have such grim view of it? You are comparing a woman soldier who has identity problem, played by an Oscar winner, from a successful movie franchise to another character who danced to the backpacked kid, wearing red spandex with glowing cheap budget lighting sign on his chest, whose trailer show half the movie, from a movie franchise who dissapointed their own DC fan, me. A teaser vs a full trailer? All seems to me you re spitting on the gal because she doesnt relieve you off your sexual tension by having big sacks.
SPOILERS When Carol punched the old woman, was I the only one who thought she could be a Skrull? Carol is of the Kree and the Kree and the Skrulls have major beef in the comics. The Skrulls were kind of owned by FOX (cos they were part of the F4 licence) but now though....
He looks an awful lot like a woman.
Captain marvel is not a woman. Trying to hard. Not worth seeing. Dont buy in to sexism.
Beatiful women.
You are all crying because its a female superhero..........spider man has literally had the same storyline. Back to back... three times over and no one complains. If its anything like wonder woman it will top the charts and be a super badass film. Lastly boys aren't the only ones that need Heros to look up to, maybe this film will be good for little girls. Ever think about that. Sick of your sad insecure negativity.  Also its the first trailer give the film a freaking chance.
I don't know why the fans of Marvel thinks that a woman with the powers of some alien can be stronger than Thor.
she's going to have the old lady crackling dry voice females always seem to favor these days.  BORING.
I can't be the only one who laughed when she punched the "old women"
The only women mcu movie.
And what does it say about modern feminists that in order for their ideology to make sense, society must be a post-apocalyptic hellhole run by blood cults under the watch of misogynist warlords? Hmm. I seem to recall a popular story about a desert warlord who treated women like property and whose followers worshiped him as a god...  but feminists seem perfectly fine with the religion inspired by THAT story.?
I feel like this film is just so Marvel can say that they have a female lead in case DC fans ever attack but truth be told it's like a rip-off of super girl, superman and wonder woman. 
or maybe not and she just gave an old woman a right hook, for looking at her funny.
Feminist: 1:31
i bet its gonna be like Wonder Woman, judging by the trailer, it would be like that generic and bland superhero movie like wonder woman, like that huge cgi final fight, so i'm not that  hyped up for this movie, maybe in trailer 2 will do
1:30 FINALLY! This movie is truly about equality. We get a female hero so it's no longer sexist AND she punched an old lady so it's no longer ageist! Fight equality FTW!!!
Stop showing us in movies that women’s are strong lol we get your point 😂 no offense
Superman goes feminist!
Marvel (Disney) has not flopped in a while you really think this movie is gonna be bad?? Think again. They would not put out something that’s going to to tie the whole story together and make it bad. I think most people are just mad that the main character is a female and she’s also the strongest avenger.
Wonder woman forever 👊👊✌
The trailer really didn’t grab me.  It seemed kind of vanilla and bland sprinkled with political feminist ideology and a few scenes from that Audi Super Bowl commercial.   Also, why do I get a DC Movie vibe from this?
captain marvel vs wonder women...
So a young Nick Fury has known about this super powered being long before  any of the avengers came on the scene. All the battles the Avengers had since, New York, Ultron, then Thanos, but know one thought to call on this so called Captain Marvel untill it was to late? I don’t think so. If this turns out to be some feminist BS just to hype up some all powerful character that’s stronger an more powerful than any of the others combined. The MCU better have a good storyline as if not, ill be done with this quicker than I am with the travesty that was Star Wars.
Why does everyone just worship the other movies, but when they have any based around a female, they go nuts.
Awesome trailer waiting for the marvels first female super hero
Seems very reactionary to Wonder Woman (not trying to cause trouble)
Look it's a woman _a woman_ superhero! How novel.
Yawn....girl power....yawn....Disney PC........Let's make her so powerful as she is a woman....lol. Nothing here looks that exciting.
This better not be a feminist movie and make her stupidly overpowered
Am one them the 32K and still increasing. The Marvel is no more the Marvel we expect. A lady, a woman as a Captain, a Hero. Hit to an older citizen is hit to the entire grand generation.  I''m not impressed
Your so thicc you should wash my dishes sense you're a woman
The accent is a huge turn off....wonder woman looks better tbh....lets see how the movies turns out to be
Another female protagonist? Stop it, females ain’t cut up for this shit.
So this is going to save us from Thanos eh? A old lady punching woman
Hope it's better than wonder woman
Wait is this this the first Marvel Female Solo film?
Im sorry, Wonder Woman who?
Now go and check out the first trailer for Wonder Woman
So this movie is getting released on March 8, aka the international women’s day?? Can I get an awomen for this iconic act!!!!!
This movie comes out on nationals woman’s day. Y
Wow man ! Women power !!
Not even close to wonder woman
They could've chosen a better looking women🌚🌝
Hollywood pushing female empowerment AGAIN...../yawn
At first I was disappointed that they're gonna make captain marvel her (not her her but the captain marvel at the spiderman cartoon series) because seriously in the spiderman cartoon series she's basically the embodiment of every feminist in the world but after seeing the trailer and a few clips of this version of her, i'm starting to feel good vibes for this movie. I'm so glad that they didn't exactly use the personality and attitude of the captain marvel spiderman cartoon series.
I honestly have no real problems with the trailer. I mean that scene where Carol punches an old lady definetly doesnt work without the context of her just being a skrull in disguise, but I can ignore that. Honestly I just don't really care about Captain Marvel in general. She is a character that Marvel has been trying to push forward for some odd reason and one I lost most of my respect for after Civil War II, though one could argue that event didn't do most of the characters any real justice. That's not to say that there isn't any potential here. Ant Man's films turned out great and they made the character a lot more interesting than he was before. I also don't like the idea of Captain Marvel being the central piece of the puzzle to save the world in Infinity War Part 2 instead of Adam Warlock. You know the guy Thanos respects the most in the comics, and also the protagonist of Infinity War in the comics? While it is possible that they won't suddenly make Carol Marvel's female equivalent of Superman, and that she'll just be great addition to the team, the way her reveal was handled in Infinity War sure worries me that they might try to give her a little to much protagonism in the next Avenger's film, though that's just speculation as of now. I'll still watch the movie in the hopes that Marvel won't give us a disappointing product, but we will just have to wait, and see.
Plot twist: Captain Marvel was the skrull and the grandmother was a poor old woman who sat in his seat
This is even better than wonder woman..
For a movie about Marvel's first female character, why was it a guy narrating the most of the trailer?
Marvel about to show dc how to make a female superhero movie
Did she really punched an old women?
Who would win captain marvel or wonder women.
She is no Wonder Woman. She is no 'Gal Gadot either. The trailer is pathetic,
So... a female Super Saiyan is now in MCU?
This is disgusting liberal propaganda their making women Superior to men they did it in battlefield 5 and now here has the world come to an end? their destroying what we love our video games and movies twisting the stories of them to make it feminist, liberal and false. The world is coming to end the liberals are destroying mankind.
Its eh doesnt get me hyped don't say I'm sexist because I was hype af for wonder woman
I’m quite excited to see captain marvel get her own movie like this is the feeling that I would get if super girl or Wonder Woman from the DC gets their own movies
here I only see sexist complaints because at last there is a movie of a female hero, complain about how boring the trailer is and assume that it will also be the "2 hours movie" (so different from these two minutes). And it is obvious that this movie will be connected with IW, but for those who did not understand: Captain Marvel develops in the nineties (idiots who believe themselves to be marvel fans!) And give him an opportunity, There is also the saying of not judging a book for its cover.
A feminist movie marvel died when Spider-Man died
I hope it does well because if not, the feminists will rage lol.
its international womens day. this movie is gonna sell like crazy just cause its premiering on that day esp with the women hype theyre selling here :)
Underwhelming. I'm an MCU fanatic and this is the first trailer I've not felt anything. I'm not digging Brie Larson as CM. However, can't base much on one trailer. Hopefully the end results knocks it out the park. Still more excited for the next Wonder Woman.
If You Think marvel for one second that people will actually pay to watch this feminist garbage you are high on all that money
New version of wonder woman.
boring woman =  boring film...
Also I'm scared with that A "Her"o thing. Not that it's not a bad play on words and what not, but I am afraid that they will just focus on the fact she's a woman. Nothing wrong with being a woman, or anything like that, however I know someone might try to take what I just said and try to twist it to make it sound like I am some raging sexist that beats women. Then again I can be wrong and people hear me out so here I go. I want more women superheroes and I want them to be great. Wonder Woman was a really fun movie and more of that is just wonderful. However I don't want her personality to be, "I am a woman and here are my political views." That's insulting to the character, the fans, the audience, and dare I say women. We've had what two huge movies now that I will not dare speak their names, that failed miserably because of that.
Basically its superman or women whtever of marvel ? Lmao
Also, I really hope the old women scene is one of those "Visitor from another world arrives to earth and sucks at social norms" scenes, and that she's indeed a normal human. That would be hilarious.
Wonder woman already won!
What if the old woman is a skrull?
Young female Ver. Nick Fury 😹 To Earth 2049
Feminist trailer.
This woman has all the charisma of a beige concrete floor
Do you think this will outdo Wonder Woman or have the same level of box office success?! 
*Marvel Studios Presents Wonder Woman*
Secret invasion... more like feminist invasion irl at this point
Typical white blond girl with superpowers. We need more black/latina/asian women as superheroes.
I’m excited for this. I’m looking forward to this movie. But if there is a feminist nazi present.... imma be hella disappointed
I am firm believer if everyone thinks something won't happen it will. I wasn't sure about character or the movie for Captain Marvel to be honest. I got turned of once they said Captain Marvel would be the strongest character in the Marvel movie universe. The one big positive I take from this movie is they not trying to over sale the movie. That is big. If they made trailer showing everything like a lot movies did then those scenes would not be as powerful. Thor Ragnarok was a big example. They could of showed Hela catching the hammer but not crushing it in the trailer. It made the scene not as powerful for me. The were amazing in the Avengers 3 trailer some of those scenes were not in the movie. So you were off balanced. Having everyone guess wrong. I loved that. I think this movie may be better then we think. I think her character will fine not every female needs to follow the classic stereotypes.
this movie sucks, wonder woman is so much better, DC rocks!!
Wow it's just create history of woman superhero solo movie
Nah,not upto Wonder Woman
First create was a female captain marvel 
She is nowhere close to our wonder woman gal gadot
🤔Wonder what the number one Halloween costume for women in 2019 is gonna be? 🤔
I like the trailor. This trailor raised respect for all women empowerment.  Long live marvel
A women superhero? Impossible!! Unless cleaning and cooking is her power
Did you know a feminist blogger got mad because Fury had more words to say in this trailer then Carol? I honestly think that’s just bullshit.
Bad: the emphasis on "her". This trailer looks like that Super Bowel Audi commercial. Give me a good personal story. please don't shove more feminism into this movie. Learn from Wonder Woman.
I had no idea there were female air force pilots in the 80s. Other than Tom Cruise, I mean.
Reminds me of Johny English beating up the old woman
To commenters complaining about facial expressions, you missed the part where she was controlled by the kree and unfamiliar with earth customs? To the anti feminist commenters, did you forget this character has existed for decades?
Captain feminist
Women shouldn't be the main character in movies
Her punching the old lady is symbolic of 3rd wave feminism finally killing off the traditional women. It's revealed the old lady said "My word! Your husband let's you wear that outfit in public young lady?" Just before Captain Marvel ends her life in a feminist rage.
I don't understand why these films constantly cast weak looking women in these roles. Gal Gadot and Brie Larson are not physically imposing at all but they're supposed to be warriors...not buying it. What happened to the Brigitte Nelson's or Lucy Lawless types? These women looked powerful yet oozed femininity. Linda Hamilton was ripped in Terminator. If you train to fight in any capacity your body will reflect that, that isn't masculine, it's biology 
So basically Superman/superwoman but for marvel
I wish they had taken a better looking actress. Why not try an actress from another race, like they did for Wonder Woman?
Women empowered overpowered
Wonder woman: Marvel edition
69k old Women figured out how to use the internet and disliked this video 😂
О! Wonder Woman, nice)
I heard the actress is a feminist and she doesn't want or need men opinion on the movie.... if true then wtf really
Upcoming overrated feminist Marvel movie with the usual dose of sarcastic comedy
Marvel be like: "And you get a compelling female lead, and you too get a compelling female character!"
Sadly the marketing’s making me think they’re gonna keep reminding us that she’s a female unnecessarily (I love the diversity of character we’re getting, I just don’t need to be reminded all the time; it really takes me out of the moment),  but I hope the film’s good enough that that sort of stuff is hard to notice or easy to ignore
Bad trailer.. not up to the mark. Over hyped movie just like antman and wasp. Nowhere near the wonder woman . Live Gal Gadot.
In the comics, As Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel, Carol has led the Avengers, adventured with the X-Men and saved the world over and over again. She’s one of the most powerful Marvel superheroes who isn’t simply a god. And in the MCU, where characters like Storm and Jean Grey don’t (yet) exist, she’s inarguably the most powerful superheroine around. For people saying she is only going to be powerful in the movie for the feminists, she’s extremely powerful in the comics as well
Not gonna lie. Not the biggest fan of female super heroes. Just dont think they're as cool as guys in terms of saving the world. Almost dont wanna watch this movie
She does not fit the part..too white farm girl like...Need a stronger woman to play her!!
Explain a trailer badly: Mace Windu finds a messed up and confused woman that beats up grandmas
ok, i understand wanting to be more inclusive when  it comes to women.... but when you start taking MALE CHARACTERS that have always been MALE into FEMALES, there is something seriously wrong. 
But hey to you that are probably going to dislike bomb my comment about your supposedly new favourite superhero, remember that in this trailer the actors face didnt blink or emote once and its about a female pilot getting super powers, yknow whats another movie that had a pilot that gains super powers? Now im not saying the movie is going to be bad as Green Lantern i mean at least Green Latern had Ryan Reynolds, Captain Marvels main lead is reeeeaallly stale. But im sure the audience that enjoy this movie probably watched Marvel punch a old lady over and over and thought that was funny.
I think the issue isn't that she's a woman, but the fact that this feels like a netflix movie, with relatively low standards set. Ladies, I have nothing against a women being a superhero protagonist, I'm sure most of use would agree.
Am i the only one who wants to see the movie not just because captain marvel is a woman?
I love how LITERALLY everyone is talking about Carol punching the old woman. 😤 ITS A SKRULL IDIOTS.
I think it oooks great as usual but I feel like the thing we know about her is that she’s a woman. They should have leaned harder on the Skrulls and the inherent drama of shape changers. Everything else was incredibly generic. And the force beam shot should have been cut entirely.
Strong independent woman
Looks really bad. Just another gotta do a female superhero movie here
Are you that threatened by a female led superhero movie that you’ll find anything however small to weaponize in your crusade to keep the genre straight, white and male? 
new age wonder woman, mediocre
Ulan feministler... Yine yaptınız yapıcağınızı
So a middle age woman save the whole world and all the heros...cant stand that
Looks like it’s going to be feminist pandering
How come Samuel Jackson got more words than her? Feminist must win here as well!!! All women are better than males!.
This will kick Wonder Woman's ass
Captain Feminist
Marvel's response to *Wonder Woman* 😅
Seems like a piece of shit feministic movie
Netflix's Captain Marvel.  This is Wonder Woman in a space suit.
Just an average woman without charisma and without buttocks.
Better then wonder woman!!!!!
1:28 “a hero” Socked an old women in the face literally 3 seconds later
So many dislikes and some hate comments......some people can't see a female SUPERHERO...so pathetic
The future is female, stay at home dads, and single moms! yupeee.
Was captain Marvel a man not a woman 🤔?
1:27 Another push for female's. I don't say this because I dislike the notion of strong female characters, but after Rey in star wars, I'm completely over it. I'm so done.
*punches an elderly woman in the face*
looks pretty shit to be honest. tried to hard to push a female lead and its looking like we got a green lantern remake.
Marvel Studios presents: Captain Punch an Old Woman in the Face. Coming 2019.
Fcking horrible. She looks like old woman
I'm a little bit dissapointed on the way that she punched the old woman because you can clearly see that they didn't even try to make an effort to make the punch closer to the old woman you can see that her hand is far away from her face
The only way you could possibly get me to watch a Captain Marvel movie, is if it was something like Captain Marvel vs Wonder Woman. And it would have to involve mud !
All that dislike are jealous womans 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 4sure .
People seem to be pissed because saving the world is now up to a woman
Feminist agenda confirmed. Dropping this.
Wonder woman looks dope
No one wants a female superhero film
Man screw Aquaman, Shazam and Wonder Woman, I'm excited for Captain Marvel movie and i cannot wait to watch it.
I hade hoped that we would get the captain marvel with bigger breasts and  than this basic woman.
Wonder Woman rip off
At last!! A hero I am able to relate to now!!! The future is like totally female now and she's like totally going to stop Thanos and save all the boys next movie, girl power!
Feminist cancer
this is so amazing. im currently crying watching this in school. Im SOO excited, I can already tell this movie is gonna empower all women everywhere ❤️💙
The framework of Immortan Joe's "kingdom" is certainly inspired by feminist theory... it's pretty much a spot-on example of patriarchy, but the film itself doesn't exactly provide a glowing affirmation of feminism. The Vuvalini are every bit as savage and bloodthirsty as the men they shun, and the first time they lay eyes on the Five Wives, they objectify them like horses, saying "This one's got all her teeth!". 
ok but why did she punch that old woman in the face
I cant ....woman....saving....just cant.
*In 2019 we will see old women getting punched*
WAAAAY better than wonder woman, or shazam or aquaman. Marvel is just way better.
Female main character better dislike it like lots of other people.
I want the same feeling enthusiastic this female superhero powerhouse, buuuut...I got meh.
So may upset boys worried that a female might come along and be more powerful than the men...
*I'd actually love to see a superhero movie with a female in the lead role, but then one that actualy acted like a female and displayed actual femininity, rather than a female who tries very hard to act like a man*
Wonder Woman  vs  Captain Marvel...
anyone compare ww to CM they're both totally different stories but both are strongest female personas we've been waited to see...! dont fight dc or marvel it's d era of superheroes let's just enjoy every mvs that's keep coming up...!
I like captain marvel and have no problem with a female lead, but why Brie Larson?
I'm a woman so i must be the strongest there is because social justice.
You know. A first Marvel Female superhero film doesn't look that bad.  Happy Halloween everyone Including Capt Marvel
Cap Marvel is very very very very  powerful because she is a woman and not because of her powers.  Another Ma'Rey s....
Tbh, its gonna be kinda lame. Its gonna be like wonder woman movie. Just about her past and leading up to when avengers started, and then link the end of the movie to being called in to fight Thanos.
Bored face woman
I can sense some feminist elements that I'm not too keen on...but apart from that I'm really looking forward to this!! ❤❤
Still no match for Wonder Woman!! 
Does anyone know when the "I'm a woman, hear me roar" narrative is going to end? Seems like every movie we have to include the outspoken feminist rhetoric force fed to the masses. Just been seeing it the past few years and have grown tired of it.
Second of all - a lot of people may not like the movie (just a prediction) as after a 10 year build up with a lot of heroic characters and a handful of powerful supervillians, this meh girl just shows up at the last minute and save everything? "historically, not awesome". Feminist agenda pushing down to our throats as it seems
This role should have been given to a women of colour.
I bet that women is a skrull
this will b probably the best Woman SUper hero Movie :)
First a black then a Female. Let’s never use white men again lol
except “a strong female lead”
I don't dislike her because she is a female superhero, I dislike her because I expect her lines will be leftwing garbage and the movie will be about empowering woman and for some reason I expect this movie to end with her punching Donald Trump in the face, say something girl powerish and then roll credits.
HER-O.    they just had to go there.    It's a woman so all the men, including Thor, Hulk, and Thanos must bow.                         Oh well, at least playing bfV with my hook arm lady will tide me over until this comes out.
1:28 "You have no idea what threats are out there" Apperently an elder woman is a threat?
Lol women can’t be superheroes
Wonder Woman was much more exciting than this appears to be. Hoping I'm surprised but I have my doubts :[
The Strongest MCU Superhero is a Female!
The future is female my friends 🙌🏼
Shazman,  venom,  antman,  deadpool, captain marvel,  wasp woman,  who will be in infinity war 2 i think thanos should not die unless they collect all super hero around the world,
Now here comes Mary Sue feminist Captain Marvel portrayed by feminist Brie Larson to save the day. Captain Marvel has done nothing to deserve a part in the Infinity War sequel and Brie Larson doesn't deserve to be the new face of the MCU.
Let’s be real this trailer is trash and to any idiot how say that this is a teaser it’s 2 minutes long and extremely underwhelming everyone has too much faith in marvel I will just see what reviews it gets and BS ones that give 5 stars for having a female protagonist I will need a friend to tell that it isn’t trash then I might see it (this what I think so don’t get your panties in a bunch)
so this the woman that’s gonna kick thanos’s ass
Wonder woman is best 😎
She punched the old woman in the face probably because it was a SCRULL
She cold clocked tht old woman....must've been an alien...had to been😕😅
Wonder woman 💛 Vs ♥️Captain marvel 
BORING!!!!   Why are all the female versions of movies so incredibly bad????
Finally a film featuring a woman. It's such a shame that films of today only feature males, portraying them as powerful gods compared to females. Three cheers for Hollywood becoming more progressive.
Women superheroes suck
Another I am woman here me roar movie....jeez...
Just how many Elderly Females are going to get hit while riding the Bus? Marvel, not thinking things through, as usual. Some dolts believe this "STUFF".
Captain Marvel (2019) > Wonder Woman (2017) and Brie Larson >>>> model Gal Gadot
This is so dumb! Woman can’t fight they’re weak and stupid
Why does it feel like female version of captain America?
*Wonder Woman has left the chat**
I wish Captain Marvel was a Man. I have nothing against female superheroes but I always Imagined Captain Marvel as Male superhero.
Yeah I get that this is a „feminist” film and so on,but I wanted to see it since I read this is the only character who is powerfull enough to the point of self-comedic value of the film.
Should have cast a black transgendered bisexual dwarf. Instead we get another white women. Get WOKE already.
A female Captain Marvel ?🤔
Again 1 more supewomen ..... 🤒  , easy marvel, make it done like Harry & other movies.....
Thumbs up if you thinks ladies are biggest hero in our life ...PS I am a guy though..  Respect to all the girls in the world.. Captain Marvel ..Wonder Woman ...
Just use women in women roles for goodness sake.
why did she punch that old woman?!seriously...why?!
For real, there is no one like wonder woman in marvel females, why even trying?
1:30 Did she just punch that woman in the face? Damn. Elder abuse.
Looks uninteresting, Captain Marvel was a man for 70 years in the comics, I bet MCU pitted a woman for the lead role because they are trying to get more women into cinemas, the directing looks cliche, cant stand these actors and directors who ride a movie with swag and fly boy attitude, I will not be going to the cinema to see this.
I'm not lowkey crying like I was with the Wondewr Woman movie! I swear!
She wishes she was as good as WonderWoman.
Spoiler alert!!! Captain Marvel will defeat Thanos to save everyone that he destroyed. Everyone have a nice day and I look forward to seeing this movie next year. They have to introduce Captain Marvel before the next Avengers so that you know who this woman is kicking Thanos's ass
Females are taking over the world
Can you imagine if it was a dude version of captain marvel hitting that old lady? Ohhh the uproar!!! 🤔 im a big marvel fan! But this looks meh! Hell Wonder Woman looks better then this! smh... I mean you make a big deal about captain marvel and all that hype is just meh? Come on man! 👍
I didnt like the trailer cause she punched an old women i mean with her strenght she could've killed her
_Let hope for good story line, releasing on the occasion of _*_International_*_ _*_Women's_*_ _*_Day_*_ _*_8th_*_ _*_March_*_ _*_2019_*
Movie: *Carol punches an old woman*
Sooo..... Female Hal Jordan.. 
Marvel's first woman solely starring in her own film: Of course I'll be good.
Female White Privilege the Movie
Woah, hey guys! What in the actual ass are you saying? Its literally not bad. And it is still just a teaser. Just because its a Female whose goin to lead the MCU in the future, doesn't mean its not gonna be good! Its going to be awesome! I mean, its Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel! 😳😍🙌
DC: We have better female led characters like Wonder Woman than the MCU! 
The comments on here, please don’t waste your time. The internet has people so immature and negative. Are the people here in elementary school or what? It’s ridiculous.  The so called little men on here hate women, saying it’s a feminist agenda. 🙄 Heaven forbid a female superhero has a movie. People saying Brie Larson doesn’t have charisma, funny how people said that about Chris Evans, real funny how people quickly judge before seeing the damn movie. Then we have the salty DC fans crying about this is a Wonder Woman rip off and Shazam is better, like STFU. I swear you people know absolutely nothing about comics and need to stop watching movies if you’re going to be this ignorant about them.  DC fans on here really need to be more concerned about why that universe can’t get their sh*t together. So called spoiled a** Marvel fans need stop bit**ing about everything.  Seriously everyone needs to grow up.
Did anyone catch her punching the old woman or?
👎 not true woman
She punched an old woman 😦
Thank goodness there's finally a faithful rendition of a female Marvel big hitter. Rogue was supposed to be great but they turned her into a weepy shrieky teenager.
Captain? Captains are dudes not females smh.
Finally another superhero female..
I'm gonna watch it just to see an old woman getting thumped in the jaw
y'all: hmmmmmmmm idk,,,,,, seems,,,, too feminist,,,,,,,
literally nobody had a problem with other heroes being eMoTiOnLeSs in trailers until a woman showed up
First female hero...........yeeap
Introducing ... the steel woman xddddddd
Can someone explain why they are making this chick the strongest avenger, is it cuz she’s female? I’m only confused because in the comics Thor could literally look at her for a few seconds and she’d die, she’s nowhere close to his level... 
Wait hold on a second, if she's from the 90s, how is it that she's putting on a voice like the kardashians or summin, no one spoke like that back then, it's totally put on and sounds cheesy as hell, talk like a real woman ffs, not a little girl, was gassed about this movie, now I kinda see who they're making this for, fake 2018 little girls, what happened to strong women?
Better than wonder woman what you all think??????
Awww!!!! C'mon. Another wonder woman? Version 2.0.
I don't know think this female power but one think he is not stopid to thanos
If Marvel made this trailer like that and you'r not hyped there's a reason, they know what they do... they could have done every thing of this trailer related to infinity war, beat thanos and make her just hot and powerful, but they want to make her special, maybe even more than the other marvel's character(cause she's the last hope against thanos and she's a woman, so they are taking the opportunity to tell something different); that's why they choosed brie larson, and that's why this trailer it's not what you expected...I honestly enjoyed it.
Like female Captain America 😊😊😊😊😊😊
I swear if this movie tanks and they blame it on the lead being a female instead of the obvious stylistic changes or poor acting of the lead I will be pretty upset.
Captain marvel is going to suck. She looks like she should be modeling shoes. A little girly girl. They should have got a more masculine woman or better a man.
Wow! That looks like a low buget crappy feminist shit!
She's far too ugly for this movie to be a hit.  Why did they pick such an ugly actress?  Let's be honest, the reason wonder woman was such a smash was the main lead was ridiculously hot - women liked the "girl power" message and the guys drooled over her.  Win win.  But this person looks disgusting - please recast!
Looks better than Wonder woman tbh 🤷
Reckon that old woman's Loki?
Thor + Wonder Women
please Marvel....dont make a cheap movie.  We have higher expectations as you know. I do like the idea of a woman character playing in this movie.....but...be careful
this is gonna be full of feminist propaganda. Cause well It's a Marvel movie, and Disney owns it now. And Disney is extreme Leftists. So yea...
The trailer looks marvelous! (Pun Intended). I don't care what anyone says, but ever since they announced Brie Larson was playing Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel I knew she was perfect for the role because her performances in Room, Short Term 12, Glass Castle, 21 Jump Street, and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World are great example how amazing she is and this trailer proves she's gonna kick ass in the role. Also I'm not just excited because it's Brie Larson or it's a female superhero, even though there's nothing wrong with that, I'm just excited because it's a new Marvel film and they never seem to disappoint with their films so I'm definitely excited to see this next year!
I like how she punched that -old woman- shiet they a skrull _kill NOW_
Captain America YES, Wonder Woman Yes, Captain Marvel Nope
Marvel: Look! Our first female lead superhero movie, she is truly fan...
Female Empowerment: The Movie.
Captain Marvel A.K.A Strong Independent Woman
I hope that old woman did not wear her false teeth that day 😫😫
Feminist the movie
Reply to DC's wonder woman
Truly hope this movie won't become a giant poster for feminist everywhere. Also hope her acting won't be to awful. Also, since they decided to go along with Marvel and not Mar-Vell, as the lead, then they better do a DAMN good job at the Marvel story line.
I look at Robin Wright playing Claire Underwood and I see the first example of a really good female lead in recent memory and I’d love to see a script of that calibre in a movie with this funding
Wonder Woman sucked so I’m passing on this
I mean, from the first wonder woman trailer I thought "alright, gal gadot is looking great,  cool locations, cool period it is set in, costume looked epic." 
         What’s the problem if a female hero is stronger than    the other males.
I hope this is better than Wonder Woman. I know this is a controversial opinion but Wonder Woman was a GOOD movie but not a GREAT movie
 This is just copy-paste over and over again. Same dramatic music. Storyline is the same every time too. BOOM opening fight scene. Over moves to the a protagonists normal office job shows some unimportant characters. More villain activity. Hero has to fight them. Hero finds a symbol. ITS EVILCORP Needs to make a plan with a cocky sarcastic female side character to reach evil corp's base. Takes it down from the inside. Boom movie ends. Sequel comes ad same thing.
Inspired from wander women
Copying wonder woman really hard
Bro she socked that elderly woman who smiled at her. Tasteless.
1:21 The blue woman looks like gigi hadid..
female main... big L
I have high hopes for this movie. I don't like what I saw from this trailer so far, it doesn't seem marvel worthy. Maybe the movie is confused and thinks this was for a DC movie... I hope it isn't a pile of crap like Wonder Woman was. Before you attack me on calling Wonder Woman a pile of crap, just admit that Wonder Woman copied the same theme and basic story as Superman in the movie "Man of Steel" which was much much better than Wonder Woman. Just because Wonder Woman was directed by a woman, I am not going to give it the 8 out 10 praise the world expects me to give it. The woman director can go cry in her "safe space" for all I care because it wasn't an original piece of work as she wants everyone to believe, just a re-telling of a girl version of "Man of Steel" which sucked at it. Both movies adopted a theme of being the chosen savior of humanity when humanity didn't deserve them, much like the story of Jesus Christ. Anyways please don't blow it Captain Marvel, the next Avengers movie is counting on you and I don't want it to end up like DC Justice League movie sitting at the bottom of the ocean with Aqua man wondering why no kid wants to be him or see him! Ever!
Looks all right. I'm more intrigued to see the skrulls. Just based off the trailer, I don't think it will be as good as Wonder Woman but good nonetheless. This trailer just doesn't have a real major moment in it that hypes me to the point I really want to see. Best trailer to me like that was Godzilla King of the Monsters because of the music and the graceful teases/reveals of the Monsters in the film. But it's only a trailer so we will see once the film is released and I will still go see it. It's a Marvel movie.
Are you the women who punched the old lady
Female empowerment: the movie lol
Wow I like it but way he is punch a old woman
This movie will be a new epitome of women empowerment.
And also it feels kind of geared more towards a female audience judging from this trailer, which is totally unneccessary. 
Trailer comes off as a Marvel series, not a Marvel MOVIE. Just saying, though I won't judge just yet- I just hope for the best, and not a generic female stand alone for the sake of it
Did she just punch and old woman in the face, Some hero she is.
Wrong cast??? They said the same thing with wonder woman
Step aside, Wonder Woman and finger snapping Thanos, Captain marvel is in the house baby.
Looks like old woman stolen her  seat that's why she smacked
Literally has a younger woman punching an old lady
Punching an old woman in her first trailer? ... crazy feminist alright haha...
ShadowSonic2 is the newest feminist troll typing nonsense to hype feminist Brie Larson's Mary Sue film.
Exciting!  Can't wait to see the movie! It gave me goosebumps. Finally.  I waited so long for female heroes/super heroes. Now , they're here. It's more than time. ❤
Is that suppose to be a sneaky way to point out she’s the first female Marvel hero to make it on the big screen
-Feminist writers at Marvel planning Captain America vs Captain Marvel, oh sorry CAPTAIN MARVEL vs Captain America
I am marvel fan..compare to captain marvel ..wonder woman is good
Again I know I might sound a little paranoid and that could be the case, but one of the reasons I stopped reading Marvel comics was I was getting tired of that being every new character. I wouldn't mind the characters have political view, or even ones that differ from my own if there was just more to them and well I really, really liked Captain Marvel back in the days when she wasn't just that. I think it's amazing that she's getting a movie and I really, want it to great. I just don't see that happening if all they do is She's a woman, so like her. Give us more than that. If not I foresee a flop in Marvel's future and I don't want that. I want this movie to be good and I want Marvel movies to keep to their guns and make movies that everyone can enjoy and can bring us all together to have some fun. Well so sorry for the essay, but I had to get this off my chest.
Honestly, tired of people expecting women to smile and be emotional. She is an Oscar winner. She knows what she's doing.
looks dope, wonder if it will pass wonder woman
So, This Movie Shows The Part Of When Did Nick Fury First Met Captain Marvel, I Mean I DID Saw The Post Credit In Infinity War But This, This Is Actually Good But Truth Be Told The Grandma Part, Im Not Even Sure If She IS Human Or Something I Just Think That From What I Saw There, There Would Be Shapeshifters But Im Not Sure If Karol (Captain Marvel) Really Punched A Human Old Woman
But u r not a beauty like wonder woman...u r compatible to Thor the mighty...the only powerful other than Thor...
Aaaand she punched an old lady....oh oh so it is ok for a woman to punch another woman...I see how it works now
She aint portraying a emotionless character, she just looks bored and unwilling to act, or maybe she is trying to act like a new age feminist? Who knows?! Well, at least im gonna have a blast mocking this character when the movie comes out ( if the trailer accurately portrayed what the movie will be).
Lmfao when the old woman smiles at her and she punches her in the face
Come on guys. This lookes dope. Young girls will be amazed to see a strong female hero
The fact that it’s a women makes me not want to see it
proceeds to punch a old woman in the face
No one ever said "she's a woman she cannot be" that's a lie. They are speaking from Comic Book "Lore" accuracy that she ISNT. These aren't opinions. They are facts. In the Comics she cannot take on Thor with the Odinforce, or World Breaker Hill. Had the Comics drawn her in and she did IN FACT beat them. There wouldn't be any argument. You cannot change History. And Historically speaking from Comics. She ISNT the strongest. 
A marvel movie and the main character is a woman 
Finnaly a Marvel Movie with a Female Super Hero
Just another bland, boring, emotionless "strong" woman. Bring back female characters that are like HUMANS, please!
Dumb female shit again....Hang It up Marvel..... LoL....😂😂😂😂😂👌
I said I wasn’t super excited for this movie on instagram and about 20 feminists said “stfu u sexist pig” all cause i said I wasn’t as excited about the movie
Trailer is underwhelming. Also why so serious? She has like one facial expression through most of it. Don't get me wrong I'm fine with her without typical marvel quips and wisecracks but I need some personality and charisma. So far it feels like any actress could be in this role. I love strong ass kicking female characters, but I dunno if it's the actress, I'm not seeing passion in her eyes.
And to barettos Che’s or what ever your name was you said she looks like a generic white girl why should it matter what race she is and how is the woman suppose to look?
one female standalone marvel movie? the feminists are taking over!
Well, I tought that wonder women was at the same level as captain marvel :/
God, I really hope this movie doesn’t bomb. So it can shut everyone right up about “how underwhelming”. Also it would just rlly suck if marvel’s first female lead movie bombed. Fingers crossed.
Are there any roles played by men in realistic parts (you know like fighter pilots, maintenance workers, etc) in the movie or is it all given over to the rubbery feminist rhetoric being forced fed to the gullible in the mainstream world of delusion and lies as fact....???  Looks like shite to me...... another blurring of the sexes to push the transhumanism agenda and all of the other trappings too...
eat your heart out wonder woman
You get a dislike for trying to tug at my heart strings with that blockbusters cameo. Also is she a skrull now? Also why does this remind me of female man of Steele? Also why does this not feel original in the slightest? Also why isn't this rocking the internet like they said it would? Also why do the special effects look off??? I have a feeling this is another black panther
It is hard to distinguish feminist propaganda movies from actually good female lead movies today
A hero is someone who can hit an old woman...
Captain Marvel AKA Woman Captain America.
So wait... is the the timeline were captain marvel gets killed and ms marvel takes over or are the just turning captain marvel into a woman
If I didn't know this movie was tied in to all the others I'd have zero interest in seeing it, based on the trailer. She doesn't have any kind of super hero vibe and it looks like a second rate attempt at making a female look like some kind of super hero. As a stand alone movie I'd guess it would make maybe $50M at the box office
Since when is Captain Marvel a woman?
Instert female lead character
Seriously this woman has no face expressions at all..
The trailer is okay but this is not a well known comic book hero like Thor and Iron Man so I think Marvel may need more as far as the trailers to really make this movie shine. Yes its the linchpin to the HUGE final Infinity War movie but the build up to that movie was literally 10 years in the making. Need a longer trailer with more backstory that puts an emphasis on Carol Danvers and who she is and how she relates to the everywomen in the world to take the movie from a big hit to a humongous hit like Black Panther, Ant Man and The Guardians IMO.
Girl power doesn't sell. Another failed female character.
Well DC killed it with Wonder Woman, lets see if Marvel can do it with Captain Marvel
I think the character has potential and the actress they chose is quite fitting but, like everyone else, I fear that this may be used to push a forced feminist agenda, Agent Carter nearly fell into this trap but this may be it.
That nasal voice, what an annoying voice for a lead character.  It's the sort of female voice that wouldn't be out of place in a breast pump infomercial.
Movie looks great, to bad Bree Larson is in it! 3rd wave feminist who openly hates men, I'll wait for it to flop and watch it on Netflix!
If we know anything about Captain Marvel, it's that she likes punching old women in the face. 10/10 marvel
I have loved this woman since United States of Tara. So glad she’s still going strong and really successful.
Am i the only one who find the character not that feminist? I'm not a feminist myself but she's just a female hero wtf is wrong with that.
More like captain feminist,lol.Fake cap marvel,the trailer looks so bland to me.
It's about time we had a female saiyan in the marvel universe...
“A hero” * punches smiling old woman in the face*
Why do i feel like that part with her hitting the old womans face is gonna stir up some drama and controversies. Gonna wait for all those articles tommorow about this
Sam Jackson again? Why are there only women in the mens roles? Looks like every other Marvel movie...
Marvel, empowering women one trailer at a time
As with Wonder Woman, I will probably miss this one also. MY opinion, I know she won an Oscar, but that doesn’t make you  Captain Marvel
Not feeling the goosebumps like Iron Man 1! What really sucks is shes probably gonna replace Iron Man in Infinity War 2! I mean really a SHE for a HE? I'm not feminist it's the fact that everybody loves RDJ as Iron Man & there gonna kill off Iron Man for Captain Marvel? I'm not happy & if that's what's gonna happen after Iron Man's dead so is Marvel movies not cool Disney not cool!!!!!
I hope her acting isn’t as bad as other female actresses
Dislikes = punched old woman
Marvel films are better than DC but this trailer doesn't even touch wonder woman one its cold,boring & that music trying to make us more curious doesn't work looked like another tomb raider, hope this movie doesn't bury future of female superohero films for another decade like catwoman did
Of course some fans or could possibly DC fanboy said this is horrible and meh, at the same time they praised WW, Shazam, Aquaman, BvS, and Justice League. The way Carol punch the old woman is much better than the entire Wonder Woman CGI fighting. This is just teaser I guess. I expect more but I know Marvel always does like this.
Dc(Wonder woman), Marvel(Captain Marvel)
another feminist film,, CRAP
Captain marvel is gonna be marvel's wonder woman...👍👍👍
Of course feminist Brie Larson and her Mary Sue Captain Marvel arrives to save the world from Thanos.
hitting old women is not okay
This is gonna be great😍😍 A female marvel superhero😍😍😍
Might not be better than Wonder Woman... But hey, Infinity War alone can kick the hell out of DC in a cliff. Now we just wait for Infinity War part 2.
Wonder woman was awesome... Captain Marvel: "Hold my beer".
Is this wonder woman 2 trailer? XD
thumbs down.will refuse to watch. captain marvel needs to be more than just a woman. she needs to be a black, aggressively bi-sexual triple amputee woman that goes to joe biden rallies and hates fox news.
Wonder woman who?
Comic book carol would have taken that women’s head off.
LOL, here comes the butthurt men who can't stand to see a strong female! And no, I'm not a feminist.
She has that annoying feminist Mary sue character look.
This is supposed to take place in the 90's? Shawna Rochelle Kimbrell was the first female African American fighter pilot. She didn't get her wings until August 2000.
Would this break wonder woman's records?
I just rewatched the trailer to wonder woman and how epic it was compared to this snoozefest, where are the cool moments and amazing action scenes, whats this all the boring face shots.  This trailer makes it look like a tv Netflix movie. And I was really looking forward to this movie but now I'm kinda meh.
Hooray for women amirite?
As an Aussie kid who was born in the 90s 1991, I am 100% stoke to see this movie for Captain Marvel. The music done by Immediate music is very powerful, Fury and Coulson as young lads are hot and amazing and so is Jude Law and Ben Mendelsohn, 90s nostalgia is sending me back to a time where I could be a kid and watch Saturday morning Cartoons without a care of the world. As a Woman this character is an inspiring message to all of us girls that we can become powerful if we believe in our selves. Go Captain Marvel.
Finally a female led action movie! I’m so excited to finally see one! Last year that is, at Wonder Woman, that movie was hype!! 
1:45 - But you guys WILL regret ripping off Wonder Woman's super power-up look.
Did I just saw a marvel Wonder Woman?
Looks like crap... a new female super hero shows up out of thin air that is stronger than all of the avengers combined? If this isn't forced indoctrination into toxic feminism I don't know what is.
They really had to highlight the "her" in hero. Can't just make a movie without instilling feminist propaganda. Also Brie's acting is flat and emotionless.
Awesome. She is also very sexy. I hope this beats wonder woman
Notice she has that same boring facial expression all throughout this trailer.  Now compare her to Wonder Woman and Supergirl; who are very cute, smiles alot, femenin, and is still powerful. Captain Marvel looks like a middle aged soccer mom who went to Burger King with her kids after a soccer game and found out her coupons expired a few days ago.
Kadın nedir abi ya.. resmen DC ye özenmişler.. wonder woman bi tık idare ediyordu da bu olmamış
Just Wonder Woman but marvel. Not gonna see it
a sad excuse for the 3rd wave feminist to pretend they are truly dominate
Wonder woman gave Marvel this confidence to make such films.
The feminists are taking over!
Looks like a female version of Green Lantern , green suit , jetfighters ...
“discover what makes her a hero” punches old woman right after*
Why is captain marvel a woman... woman aren’t good superheroes this is just a very popular opinion people like buff manly badasses not girls with big boobs tryna be harasses with high pitches voices they don’t look badass this girls looks like a voiceover from teen titans
I need a bad ass women like jean gray as the dark phenix
Ehh. It looks alright. I feel like its going to have alot of women empowerment BS.
Wonder woman trailer nailed it. 😎
Captn marvel is not pushing hollywood pushing female lead roles at all.....hahaha. fail
Most of the people watching this probably don't know the real reason why Carol hit the old woman lol
she almost killed the old woman. (SPOILER)
to be honest this trailer is not that good or outstanding, it looks like a trailer Dc could have made and im not really excited to see Captain Marvel in action because she just looks like a female superman or greenlantern, and not an original or unique superhero form marvel :/ If this is the best they got after the core avengers are gone thats gonna be tough.
People are pissed of that Sam L. Jackson (a man) got more lines than the actual main character (a woman).
All the feminist now can die in peace
I'll pass, bottom of the barrel. How about the death of captain marvel cancer story line. Has to be another strong female lead role instead.
Your next installment of feminist comic book garbage.
Terrifying old woman
* Punches an old women...
what makes a "her"o, really? But whatever that's the only "feminist-y" thing in this trailer so I'm fine with it. I just hope the film remains relatively apolitical, for its own sake.
As long as it’s not as awful as wonderful woman.. black panther did a much better job with their women characters .. hope that trend continues in Captain Marvel
Hate when movies try to make female characters the lead roles just so they can show they’re progressive.. like be realistic here man.
BUT THOSE LAST FEW SECONDS OF THIS TRAILER IS SO AWESOME~~~! Yay for another female superhero movie ;D
Woman leading men yet again. She's hot though!!
oh no its a girl. feminism strikes again. Please if this movie is feminist propaganda then I will agree with you people but until then you just sound like salty nerds
Generic marvel movie. Nick fury has hair so kinda Captain America but a woman and not that far back. I'll probably not be hyped for this. Will probably not have anything that'll spark my interest enough to watch on opening night.
It is going to be some feminist bullshit 
Superman: The Woman- The Movie
its actually sad seeing people complain that the main star for this is a woman like grow up
1. Absolutely NO social justice or feminism stuff in it. At all. People are sick of being told women are weak, men are terrible, and that they need to bring men down to bring women up. Even most _women_ hate modern feminism (81%). It is a cancer and social justice IS GUARANTEED TO KILL YOUR MOVIE. Just look at Marvel _Comics_ if you don't believe me. Or Star Wars. Alienating 99% of your audience for that "woke" market is just stupid business that only stupid people would condone. *NO POLITICS!*
Ahahahah she punshed that old woman so hard!!!!!!
Because punching grannies is always a crowd pleaser? At least it's realistic for what an average woman can deafeat in combat.
this kinda reminds me of a female green lantern
Whats up with all of these oh CM isnt the strongest she couldnt beat thor etc. Theyve explicitly said she's the strongest or is it because she's a woman that it makes it impossible for people to understand?
I like that they didn’t do any I’m a strong independent woman bs. They’re letting her stand on her own merits as a hero
Of course they had to get this out when feminists are at their peak of being annoying pieces of shit. I'm sure that they won't be blowing anything out of proportion just because she's a wahmen.
Feminist agenda hear me roar.
This movie look so good! Is like Wonder Woman on steroids.
After star wars & wonder woman I just don't think Hollywood knows how to create a good superhero / fantasy movie anymore.
To the haters, you do know that in the comics captain marvel was always a female? Because if didn't know that you nowhere near being called a fan!!!
**punches old woman**
Looks like a better looking non cringey shitty acting CW Superwoman.
Not sure if casting is right fit for the lead character. We needed a chiseled blonde white woman with a slightly different face. Not sold on this one.
That's my Wonder Women
I mean... Which superhero would give a straight out punch on face of an innocent old woman??
why do ppl always make women so powerful that they’re the strongest beings on the earth?😤🙄
Imagine how much butthurt would be if cpt marvel would be a man and punch that old woman...
Leave it to a woman to have to save the day lol
This looks okay. Although I think it's just a Marvel version of Wonder Woman so that they have some competition. Like I didn't even know they were making this movie until afterWonder Woman came out.
Had to be a woman 🙄
Grandma: Oh nothing, only that a woman in a weird suit punched me for smiling at her
For the people talking about wonder woman is better than captain marvel just look the views actually and think x)
nah, I don't like female superheroes, sorry.
Only crazy drunk feminists can like this crap.
super captain marvel aka woman
The best part in this trailer is when she punches an old woman in the face with no context given whatsoever
Feminist version of Top Gun but instead of Tom Cruise becoming the best pilot he becomes brainwashed by scientologists and then turns into an alien with superpowers.
What? And is this the most dangerous woman in the universe? Looks wretched
Female Green Lantern
She punched that poor old woman in the face lol
Just like superwoman 
Feminist now wants to be call woman bcoz theres a her in hero
She is supposed to be a HE. But we live in 2018 so women have to be empowered
Propaganda feminista
A female superhero movie? *the feminists are taking over*
I can’t wait for this overpowered feminist wet dream to ruin infinity war part 2, why would they leave all of the original avengers cast alive at the end of part one, sending a strong message thematically, if they are just gunna add this bitch and use her as the ultimate plot device. This movie is going to be shit first of all, just like ant man and the wasp was shit, I just pray to sweet merciful Buddha that her shit doesn’t drag into part 2.
Looks good to me. Seem some of the anti feminist are upset though LOL
She hit an Old woman.
Boogie woman is coming for you! And Thanos doesn't know what's coming!
Soo.... female Superman + The Matrix????
Can’t wait to see her punch that old woman’s face on the big screen
Old woman: I'm sorry
Wonder Woman was better
My only hope is that feminist politics stays the hell away.
Looks like the Wonder Woman movie got competition. 😏
I just have a good feeling that this would be a great movie. I could be wrong, but I am 97% sure that this would be great; nonetheless, I'm still gonna support this movie coz Brie Larson is Captain Marvel. She's one of the best actresses of her generation and this woman deserves all the recognition that she could get. Also, thank you for the meme template 1:31😂.
I doubt it'll make 1 billion dollars at the box office, but hopefully it makes more than Wonder woman.
if you want women power you dont have to make it all about women power just make her a cool super hero...looks crap
doesn't look so good than Wonder Woman
Finally Carol Danvers has arrived, you guys should learn about her comics as Ms.Marvel and Captain Marvel, she is the strongest female character from Marvel beside Scarlet Witch and not point to compare with entities like Phoenix ( Jean Grey, Rachell and Hope Summers).
Feminists Assemble!!!
Meh, Wonder Woman is probably gonna be better. The thing that gets the good reviews will be the Post credit scene.
Yay! When this comes out people can stop pretending Wonder Woman was good! We will actually have an awesome female hero! Not some paper-thin doll like Patty made her.
Such garbage ,cat woman. Nothing you. Then she will join batman.
I thing, This for increase Female Audience. Bcs Natasha not enough... 👮‍♀️👩‍✈️
So I don’t wanna hate but I’ll be mad if they use this movie to push some sort of feminist agenda.
Is captain marvel a woman ?????????????????
This beats wonder woman af
I thnk, wonder woman much prettier than capt. Marvel.
That old lady is most definitely a Skrull, for those that were wondering why she punched that old woman. Lol.
Could they have not casted a lady who has a more powerful presence on the screen?  Brie Larson in this looks Aggressively Mediocre.  Like a female Keanu Reeves - no umph or power or confidence in her acting.
She is the woman who will save us from thanos ✌️✌️✌️✌️
did I saw batwoman at 1:40..?😕
It is not like the wonder women
Take that, Wonder Woman.
If I’m not mistaken CM is the first female protag to get her own movie in the main MCU (And we’ll forget about the mess that was Elektra)
me recordó mucho a wonder woman xd
*Watches how she smash the shit out of an oldwoman*
Oh dear. She looks too serious! The Capitan Marvel in the big Marvel poster in my room looks happy, confident, maybe even cocky, I imagined her a female Han Solo! Please tell me Marvel isn't turning her into a stoic Man of Steel snooze fest...
"discover what's makes a hero"  *punches an elderly women*
Did she just sock that old woman in the face?! 1:30
just say you hate powerful female superheroes and go home y'all are annoying
Not as strongas Superman or Wonder Woman, or Aquaman, or Flash, or Cyborg....
I like this trailer and captain marvel will be a hit. feminist or not
1:31... when somebody calls you supergirl or  the female shazam
Wonderwoman sucks! Captain Marvel rocks! She's here
When her hair is down she looks like Amy Polher and it's just sooo gross!! There has got to be a way to edit this woman's face to make it appealing!
*captain marvel punches an old woman*
It's superman and wonder woman combined into one
This trailer is just boring cause they are trynna push this women can be strong top agenda throughout this whole trailer
This reminds me of the Supergirl show so much, the music, the way everything looks, the female protagonist, the fact that she's an alien...idk just a thought
The Last Jedi bad feeling about it. GIRL POWER. Kathleen Kennedy. Feminist movement. HER...O. It just doesn't look amazing. Wonder Woman had it in its first trailer. Not this one.
Las feministas ahí vienen
i think that there is no need of another superhero because we already have a bunch of them and this character seems to be more feminist or useless...
She is the coolest woman in the Universe. Brie Larson, that is.
Looks pretty good, but please for the love of God don't pretend that it's the first movie ever made to feature a woman then act as if any criticism is equal to misogyny.
This seems a bit underwhelming, as compared to wonder woman.
Feminist bullshit incoming on march 8
Please don’t be a feminist movie
No one cares about women superhero’s.
She Reminds Me Wonder Woman In Some Way😍
Looks pretty generic compared to previous marvel trailers, wonder women trailer was better, even though I m marvel fan.
I’ve never have wanted to punch an old woman so bad in my life.
Poor old woman lol
great another female movie, sucks
When she punches the old women 😂
more feminist cgi lacking of history shitty movie
Its a hype movie ,but I swear any feminist propaganda ima be mad
Finally a women superhero solo marvel movie 💕💕💕
This is gonna end up like the female version of Ghost Busters. 🤣
Personally, I think it is awesome that we are at a point in society where Gender and Race are so unimportant in movies, that we have a Superhero who is female, rather than a Female Superhero.
*punches old woman in the face*
I hope she was a good casting choice for the role, I don't want another broken female character who doesn't act like a human. Star Wars failed. Wonder Woman succeed.
Feminist movie, here we go.
Needs a little more personality. I like it though. But it is starting to become a trope where female leads are emotionless and tough. Gamora is still the best female hero though, followed by scarlet witch, followed by black widow, and followed by okoye.
Waiting for some tards on one side to think this is feminist propaganda and the other side think this is girl power bc blah blah blah women don’t get lead roles blah blah. Let me stop you there.  Captain marvel has always been a thing since the original comics, so don’t drag your knuckle dragging politics into this
And they must a black woman as support(why not main character?)
Why this CAPTAN MARVEL it's woman, why it's old all the movie, and why it's making stuff like punch grandmas ?
So like is it a trend to make all woman act like men (masculine) now???
I feel Brie Larson is a dry actor and they are just going to use her to show women power. I am going to be fine with this movie atleast if she isn't super overpowered.
Hell, it's about time we got a female Green Lantern.  Next, we'll see Brie Larson in a red costume cracking jokes while cutting people up.
She has balls no doubt.  Woman power!  At least women can start changing flat tires from here on lol
Nonsens whats happening here. I did a little search. I watched all previous marvel trailers and many comments (before premier mostly) too. Result: almost nothing about the males acting. Maybe 1 Tom H. but under CM at least 5 times (even more now) about her acting (after 600 comments). We speaking about a trailer...a TRAILER! Dont tell me that in other marvel trailers we saw outstanding acting because its not true. She was serious? Yes because she had to be here thats all. After 10 years you guys still dont know what we will get? Humor, badass cgi, 2 other trailers maybe and a whole FILM. And the feminism...I read it under WW trailer too. Here more. You guys must be women haters or just cant stand if a woman identify oneself with something (Yes it can be too much but not here). This is the 21th century ffs. What a shame we still be here (and not just film industry ofc). Btw BL has an oscar and she CAN smile too... 'unbelievable'. Keep working MARVEL and good luck DC :P. Gal G and Brie L rocks!
A movie abut a female superhero... yeah dislike and not seen this shit
Captain Marvel is a woman now?
Grandma was probably a skrull or just a dick either way this looks a million times better than that boring Wonder Woman movie.
How do any of you think she’s punching an older woman? How do you not realize it a Skrull?
This woman is disrespectful, punching a granny like that?
Ooo another strong female character, how progressive. No thanks looks dumb
That granny got punched for asking'"are you wonder woman?"
I think that marvel consider the woman as a powerful hero is very impressive  However,  From my point of view , woman who is acting as a captain doesnt give the feeling of magical power  , her acting seems a little bit raw/poor . Of course I havent watched it yet this is just trailer . I hope while watching my minds will be change .
Little worried with the whole her becomes a hero thing we've all seen what happens to feminist movies Ghostbusters, oceans 8 all heavily feminist based and bomb like a middle eastern village. Willing to give it a chance as it's marvel and they know how to handle their characters however a little sceptical. Just my opinion everyone is entitled to their own and I fully respect theirs.
People down here in the comments like "A Womans! I is dones wif teh Marvel!" And the other half is like "Murder all men with genital mutilation!" All humans suck. All of them. This movie looks fun.
This woman is going to beat thanos' ass
Wonderwoman quien te conoce
I didn't know women could be captains
I think Wonderwoman Is better in a BIG way
I guess Wonder Woman is going to be a transsexual  man in the next movie.
It's like: Woman with alien's powers > The God of Thunder :v
R.I.P Old Woman...
RIP Wonder Woman
 *Hits an old woman in the face*
I want to be able to enjoy this movie. I don't care if she's a woman or not just don't make a big deal about it. Please.
Okay, really though, why is she punching a random old woman. It's probably an enemy in disguise, but even then it's not really benefiting the trailer in any way. It also takes away from the specific moment in the movie because now we'll be looking for it.
Wow that looks worse than wonder woman.
Marvels first GOOD female superhero movie (let us never speak of Elektra)
I hope this movie is better than the hype. This female superhero movie needs to be done properly. If Captain Marvel is a feminist in this movie, don't make her be like "men are disgusting pigs and don't deserve to lick the dirt off my boot" rather have her come off as " I'm just as good as anyone else here and let me show you why I deserve to be here" equality is not making the oppressors feel inferior, rather letting them know that you are equal to them. Equality root word EQUAL. With that being said, Marvel, don't sacrifice good writing for making her bent on being seen as equal. What I mean by that? Write an incredible story that incorporates her desire to be seen as just as good as anyone else. Marvel is known for making awesome stories. Heck, they made Ant-Man a movie to enjoy. Freaking ANT-MAN. And they made TWO of those. They did Black Panther well with potraying how we black people want to be seen, now lets see how they handle women w Captain Marvel.
Man I hate women sUPeRhero movies this looks lifeless
Basically Marvel's version of Wonder Woman.
I am a DC fan and I am a big fan of Captain Marvel, even though the trailer is OK, I want to be wronged at the theatre. But please don't make her like Rey in Avengers 4. You can make her a hero after that but for now, the original Avengers should save the universe in Avengers 4. Please don't continue the feminist propaganda, make her likable and inspiring like Gal in Wonder Woman!
Wonder Woman Comic-Con (1st) trailer: 29.8 millions of views and 243K likes.
To people who are saying anti-feminists are hating on thin
when considering female super heroes wonder woman is too better than miss marvel..
New women hero was Born in Marvel Flim.
Next Captain America: surprise it’s a woman now 🎉
Gal Gadot is incredibly endearing as Wonder Woman and really got me pumped to see more women joining the superhero roster. Brie Larson however just looks bored in this role, I hardly care for this movie.
She a hero becouse she beats old women haha WTF
People are saying that this movie is going to be worse than Aquaman and Shazam, but none of the movies have come out yet. Plus, of course the trailers for those DC movies look better. They need to look better. If things go well, they could revive the DCEU. The MCU doesn't need that. Besides, Marvel's probably trying to avoid giving away the entire movie. DC already revealed that Steve Trevor is coming back for Wonder Woman 1984.
Still trying to figure out when Captain Marvel became a woman? I must have stopped reading comics around the time I happened.
im sorry but i can't accept a women as superhero... sigh..
Ugh.  Another female character no one outside of comic book nerds has even heard of.  Marvel is just pandering to women's rights groups at this point.
Another  feminist  agenda, disney  will now destroy marvel like they did star wars, is anyone  able to stand up to theses pc pushers  yes Jordan peterson
So finally Marvel gives us a female superhero movie!
Didnt blow my mind but doubt anything will after Infinity War!! Looking forward to seeing it...avoiding all trailers from not on, Ive had a peek enough for me. Glad they didnt do the old 70s origin with her being Mar Vells lil female sidekick/occasional rescue target and made her an actual soldier amd pilot. If I'm 100% honest past few yrs in the comics (yes everyweek all of em...dc too their stuff amazing at minute) I have really disliked verging on hating Captain Marvel. Been portrayed as practically a space cop nazi stormtrooper where if you didn't agree with her there was no discussion you were wrong, she sas right run, go to jail or fight. He current runs good but still cant shake past few yrs of super nazi fascist but going into this with fresh eyes. Marvel films have earned every little bit of my trust to make at the very...VERY least an entertaining, action flick with characters treat with care but changed for screen only when needed al, the way up to your Winter Soldiers level where their practically perfect renditions but fresh takes on plots from comics but made with actual attention, care and make sense....as much as space gods and cybernetic raccoons can make sense. I'm not worried, not complaining, happy to let they hype train go past without a look and be happy to go see it and make my own mind up. I hate idiots that make films about agendas (thats both sides of the blah blah boring) specially when film doesnt have an agenda...none of marvels have just been always solid, always enjoyable comics....on screen and what more do you want. Brie a great actress, seen a few films with her but.....and this tiny nit pick....like miniscule but her voice....it's very soft isnt it or is that me? For some reason always mentally read her with a more drill sergent type voice but thats my prob I'll either get over it or wont. Ill have to wait and see but definitely happy to wait. To the complainers, when has Marvel made something terrible....other than the special effects in the Black Panther last fight...anyone defends the 90s rubber men on the train bit are zealots! Lol but never a terrible film. Thor dark world was meh but thats it and that was yrs ago so complain, moan, whatever you'll still go to see it. What you gonna do pay your money and sit and sulk in protest at some niggle lol itll be fine at least and might do a Cap WS and come outta nowhere as amazing. Not long we'll soon see......but AVENGERS 4 THO! God why Marvel why I want it noooooow! Lol
Wonder Woman... you're on notice.
better than Wonder Woman
And by the way we get the fact that this is supposed to be female empowerment. You don't need to have the word her phase into the word hero. Just have a awesome female character that women and men can both look up to.
Seems like Marvel tried a female Superman
Yesss a female hero like Captain America, Yesss. Wait is she the one Fury texted before he disappeared in Infinity war? 😦
They totally rewrote the Marvel Universe for this... just like we all knew they would.  They are going to try to "top" *Wonder Woman*, and they cannot. It is going to be just like I suspected.. A Third Wave Pandering Cluster.
Captain Marvel vs Shazam or Wonder Woman
Brace yourself for the fanboys and their 101 reasons how it’s better than Wonder Woman
For the sake of diversity let's make her into a guy who is actually a woman oh yea plus let's make them black or Asian
Ultra Suspenseful as heck music for a woman doing cgi stuff??? Hahahahaha
How the hell do you make a female lead who looks less invested in the proceedings than Gal Gadot?
The only reason why this movie was made Was to fulfill the feminist  Agenda, And Marvel gave up Everything that them special and a good movie company/comic book company  Just to make a few feminists happy , They don't even care about their movies anymore, They just care about whether they make certain groups happy. What now they're gonna to remake every movie in the mavel universe but with all the cast being girls
if this movie doesn't get an abs of steel reveal in front of a mirror I'm going to be very upset. spiderman got it, captain american and even thor. we need a woman to show these boys she can rock killer abs.
Otro film, para dar mas poder a la campaña feminista.
And if you think about it, a fish out of water story...where have I seen this before, oh yeah...this is a Wonder Woman rip-off.
evidenced by the actions of feminists throughout history. Feminism is
Am I the only one who doesn't care for Captain Marvel, especially after this trailer? It's not because she's female, either. I mean, I can't wait for the Black Widow movie ... but ... this ... I don't know. I'm ... I ... Oh, well. At least it's Marvel.
Do people enjoy woman action movies as much? I like the fact women are getting lead roles in big movies, but I can’t imagine the movies doing nearly as good. Maybe I’m wrong !
i really liked Wonder Woman a lot! But i never wanted to see it again like i did with other DC movies. It didn't have much replay value. Captain Marvel seems great, i hope it will be as great as Captain America Winter Solider which was great to see more than once.
Some people were saying that nobody likes Captain Marvel because she is a woman, guys??  M one of those who hates captain Marvel and only reason is she is gonna ruin Avengers 4.Even if Captain Marvel was a man I would've said the same. If u agree with me then like and if don't then comment please .
I personally liked this trailer, thought it was nicely executed. I’m just hoping, nay praying that this movie isn’t an overbearing feminist campaign. Just please. Don’t. Marvel help me out here.
old woman: punches back
I bet nobody saw that coming, a elderly women as the movies main villain. I bet it’s thanos’s mom
Is it me, or is this the first movie that Marvel has done where a female is the main character?😆
Wonder Woman is better
Wonder Woman plz kick her ass so she might show some emotion
Marvel superhero can finally beat women as they got a woman as hero get it.
of course its a woman
*Yeetus yeetus old woman beatus*
She is different from other woman superhero coz she is not sexy n she is cool..love it
"How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old woman?!"
Wait , Captain marvel is Female ?
fuckng feminists are taking over marvel  cant have anything cool without these vunts showing up
When is Marvel going to release Captain Sandwhich? Never heard of it? Its an older tale. Its about a woman who stays home to make sandwhiches for her husband the construction worker, the real ultimate superhero story
Well, it's not to the caliber of the Wonder Woman official trailer but it did tweak my interest.
Looks boring, not going to watch it. Sticking to Wonderwoman
I’m not seeing this, maybe later, I need a break from ‘female power!’
I am going to see this movie for the sole reason that I want to see Captain Marvel punch an old woman in the face.
So.. I take it the end credits will show us Carol in a back Alley somewhere, she hears someone call her name only to see a young woman's arm reach out as her bare hand grabs Carol. 
pls dont me a feminist shit movie.. just a normal superhero movie.
*Wonderwoman vs Captain Marvel*
Wonder woman was and will be far better than this
But of course feminist Brie Larson and her Mary Sue Captain Marvel shows up to save the day.
Hmm everything actually looks really good hear, except Brie Larson’s interpretation. I’ve always seen Carol (and she’s always been depicted) as more of a hard edged Sarah Conor type. Here Brie seems to be portraying her as awkward or foreign. Even Gal’s Wonder Woman had a rougher edge in her first trailer than Carol seems to have here.
Finally, a female lead that isn’t as insufferably perfect as Ray.
You know, if you were gonna make all of those half assed female marvel films/shows, you coulda just gone with this
And now captain Marvel is a woman????
A. Yes, please! B. Adore Brie. C. Coulson lives! (In the 90's anyway.) D. Sam Jackson is a bad MF. E. Marvel - you need to Rehire James Gunn or people are going to sit Captain Marvel out. And none of us want to. We want CM, what it leads to with A4, and a female lead. But, we also want justice!
Hyped for this movie but the trailer seemed a bit lackluster. I was waiting on this trailer forever to see how Marvel would handle a solo female lead. In my opinion it just seems like the movie'll be heavily imitating Wonder Woman, but thats just me.
DC makes wonder woman and disney copies them smh.
Why punch old women laa?!?
Can we get a black female super hero? Congolese maybe?
Couldn't they have found a better actress? Like seriously. At least DC whom I don't really like generally have managed a waaaay better actress with their Wonder Woman.
Yeah a female superhero movie. That's what we needed -_-
Yet another movie I will not be watching because it is gynocentric rather than factual.  Everything now days is feminist based rather that based on the original ideas by the creator.
I'll skip this one, this woman looks like the Woman of Steel.
One Punch Woman
No Carl Manvers and no feminist speech, so it's going great!
When she punched that old woman I was like " OHHH SHIT" lmao
yeah. i waiting for this. please make a movie better than other super woman hero
I hope Marvel doesn't think this will be their version of Wonder Woman
5/10 wonder womans
I cant wait for wonder woman to be a man.
Maybe better than Wonder Woman
Ah yes. True heroes ALWAYS punch elderly woman in the face.
Shi Fu: She's a woman
#1 trending in movie for crazy drunk feminists
What's this feminist shit
I am really excited for this movie to come out, growing up it was difficult to find female heroes to look up to in movies and tv.  There were some Dana Scully is one of the main reasons I went into the medical field!  The fact that Disney is putting women in position to save people and not just be saved is going to be amazing for little girls growing up today.  I also feel like this is great for Disney because they are marketing hero movies to children, which means an increase in sales in toys and movies!  Everyone wins with a movie like this.
Can't tell if she's female because they want her to be or because of feminism...
A female really? Must be a hollywood feminist movement of equality and women should replace male superheroes after Ages and ages of having a Male Captain Marvel. I have nothing against females but this is just getting ridiculous
this is releasing on march 8. international woman's Day.
fake likes don't change reality: this is feminist crap
So excited for more female superheroes!!!
POLL: Captain Marvel or Wonder Woman?
A whole two hours of watching this woman do that serious "I'm a strong woman" face.
Good thing it's a movie. U give a woman that much power in real life. All the bad men in history will be nothing in comparison. Cause when a woman goes bat shit crazy (& they alwyas do) she could destroy the world in a day & apologize later when it's too late. Always happen.
First female superhero movie!!!
Brie Larson is still soooooooo beautiful even when in a superhero suit. Wow! Wooohooooo!! Love the Captain Marvel suit by the way. Truly the women empowerment
Not being sexist or racist here, however, you know this movie will get good ratings (same as bp) because there is a woman as the leader, instead for bp it was someone of different race to the ones told before.
Fake wonder woman
That is one ugly woman.
I think this movie is going to inspire a lot of women.
Marvel knows business. First kids, then black people, now females.
What a fn joke. Disgrace to the whole universe and fans who have been waiting for an actual Marvel movie. Marvel is not a woman. I repeat is not a  woman. Just pc shoved down our collective throats till we choke on it. Well I’m choking.
our wonder woman with no expressions will be better than your wonder woman with a beautiful face and amazing personality dc
WTF, NOT INTERESTED AT ALL!!!. Come on marvel. Its just boring. Even wonder woman is better.
it's nice to see strong woman take up numbers in movies. 
Not watching! Tired of all the Girl Power movies. Stop neutering the male society and and making them the bad guys all the time. We need Male Heros and women that know how to make sandwiches.
Marvel's version of a female Superman! 🤔
Marvel Ready To Make That Wonder Women Money Off Of This Movie!!
Female super hero saves the avengers and the universe. Feminists will love this...
Thank god they didn't change her race like miss marvel and made her into a muslim women
Isnt this the actor that played superwoman in the flash DC Series?
Scarlet witch will alway be the strongest female in marvel
If the hero is a woman... Then we  must escape !
She's giving me scarlet witch/wonder woman vibes at the same time
women with monotonous acting: "bleak", "underwhelming", not convincing
kapten?? women??
outta all the woman they could have got.....  smh
Female Version of Thor.... Seems fair
"Blonde woman beats up senior citizen in public train"
Please not be a feminist movie, Please not be a feminist movie
Right in the comics there is Captain Marvel and Miss Marvel right? So not hating that she is a women but shouldnt the title be 'Miss Marvel'. not and expert so someone correct mr if im wrong
1:39 We got Batwomen
The Title is captain marvel but its a woman.
Please dont let this be some feminist ghostbusters 2016-ass flick and just be a lit marvel movie
Wonder woman > Captain Marvel > Rest of DC
Oh, a woman, main role in a movie as a protagonist, will probably be worse than wonder whore, I hope I'm wrong
Okay, she just punched a old woman. I wanna see it now
still ,  i love Wonder Woman
The hero of the movie is not a man or a female but the story, if the story is written well then what after it will be good and if it is written bad then what after it will be bad
Wonder Woman >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> What ever is this
Superwoman in disguise
I don’t get why guys  are pissed because of a female superhero? In the case of wonderwoman everyone started fapping but you can’t do that here so bunch feminism is going on here
I'm hoping that starting with this movie, the film industry can bring back the *EMPATHETIC* strong female character. The kind of strong female character that is enduring and timeless like Ellen Ripley, Sarah Connor, and The Bride. The kind of strong female character that kicks ass and does awesome stuff, but even more importantly, goes through hardships, takes losses, makes sacrifices, grows as people, and builds strong connections to other characters AND to audiences.
And give that woman...... A shield?
Aye, hittin' the cinema on International Women's Day. n1 Marvel.
I'm going with DC. For years, I saw every marvel movie and i'm seeing a slope here. Your adding a female character who your trying to turn her into YOUR Wonder Woman. Miss Marvel is supposed to be more grounded and faces the reality of being alienated by another life form while adapting back to our society at a ( technically) mutant. Here, you took Wonder Woman turn her into Green Lantern. I am NOT amazed by your movies, trailers, cast, and screen writers any more. If you want me and others to buy the tickets and products, you NEED to step up the realism and get rid of the fiction!
cant really connect to a female superhero..
Curious to know if a majority of the people that don't think this trailer is good are just manchildren that don't know how to cope when a female superhero is superior to the male ones and doesn't flounce around in a frilly revealing outfit. Without Captain Marvel the Avengers stand no chance in beating Thanos... like seriously look up what she is credited with having abilities of just from her appearances in comics. Get over the fact it's not some buff white guy leading a film and who will most likely defeat Thanos and save all of the Avengers. 
Womad support Feminist Brie Larson!! Girls can do anything!!
Guys I forgot can women be strong too or...?
Everyone who says they aren’t excited are made fun of by feminists like “probably cause you can’t handle a strong woman” or maybe it’s cause the trailer looks boring as hell
Oh god, here we go. You can clearly tell they are gonna push the feminist bullshit into overdrive on this one.
Captain marvel : the woman who is going to beat you.
Feminists gonna be at their peak cause of this movie smh
basically supergirl and wonderwoman in one
1:32 ha got u drugdealer oh crap it's just an old woman well,I guess I have to go into hiding for 29 years
Shity woman super hero... End of the world
01:27 Yeah, it's yet another empowered female to save the day!  She will have no flaws, keep her calm when all the men around her are powerless and clueless, and she will tell many men what to do in the movie!  Yes!
Sadly, I WAS looking forward to this movie, and even the female Captain Marvel. But knowing how atrocious the actress, well, acts in real life, I cannot support it.
Wait...did she just punch an old woman ??
I think Marvel would deliver a good movie again unlike DC's wonder woman, batman vs superman etc... Marvel has been in top of it's game, also can't wait for Thanos 2 in 2020
Dark Phoenix. Female led superhero movie. No smiling. All serious. Didn't reveal the story. People love the trailer and can't wait. No cries that the actress is bad without emotion. No cries that the actress needs to show some sort of emotion. That probably mean that it isn't a sexist issue with this trailer but the problem is the acting and the trailer itself.
Green Lantern female reboot? :pIt is Disney.
Isn't punching grandma violence against women?
She just destroyed that old woman
What would happen if Cap Marvel vs Wonder Women??
The skrulls are the hero’s and captain marvel is the villain, she punched an old woman in the face!
If this movie has any feminazi propaganda bullshit in it, Im not gonna watch it. Or Avengers 4 If she is in it. "Women are strong" "Women are smart" "respect women" we get it stfu. Women want to be equal but they never will be. Meh will always be stronger and smarter than women because thats how nature works. So please Marvel, for the love of God don't turn this movie into a gut wrenching, vomit inducing womens rights movie because they have been equal for years, and have plenty of benefits over men.
*Wonder woman killer*
Yup strong women like to punch old women......Thats how the world works
Why can’t the feminists invent their own superheroes? Captain Marvel is a man...not a tranny. 😂
Number 1 on Trending. Marvel your the best. For making one of my favorite female superheros come to life. Thanks so much. I can't wait
Another super woman
They lost me with the future is female crap.
Wonder Woman *noticeably scoffs*
Wonder Woman was a good movie, but this does not look very good at all.
...cool...cool...but I'm just waiting for this to be turned into a feminist thing, just wait.
Hopefully they don't try to push feminist views I as a woman am not in the mood. Give me marvel not a lecture about how women are repressed.
Basically it’s a female vision and we all know what happened to him 😂
I hope that old woman isn't a Krull
Captain Marvel vs Wonder woman vs Black widow vs Catwoman ????
why dislikes???? Actually ignorant people cant accept a female superhero
if I was a feminist, I'd squeal with delight
why did she punch that old women :D ??
Then ppl saying "mary sue"??? is every single powerful female character this mary sue? superman is one hell of a mary sue but i don't see people going around and calling him a mary sue, etc!!!!
Only feminist liked this
Wonder Woman Trailer is better.
Wonder Woman Didn't like this
Marvel pushing the Feminist agenda!
Why we never get black official female super heroes. I have no idea 😏
Im not impressed with the trailer whatsoever. Im still geared up for Aquaman and Shazam and Wonderwoman next year.
Meh trailer. And it’s the first Marvel movie to feature a lead woman. I smell sexism
How to ruin entire movie universe by one female hero
Does this woman have any emotions?
About time! Finally, a female lead in the Marvel series!
Punches an old woman 
Okay! is this Superman Women/Marvel version? Huh? Lol
team wonder woman
Marvels Wonder Woman
After Captain Marvel there will be first *Muslim Female* superhero, Which is written by *American-Pakistani* girl (Sana Amanat) based on her own story and of course she isn't superhero, based on her story about how she struggle.
Seriously is this Marvels poor attempt to take on Wonder Woman.  I would rather see Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow in her own movie. I'll PASS!!!
Wonder Woman’s better 🤷🏽‍♂️
I have a sneaking suspicion that it won't be as good as wonder woman. Can someone from Marvel save Gal Gidot from the DC universe?! Please!
Edit: and that old women she smacked was the real villain.
So i'll wait for the reviews from "women of colour and teenagers" Skipping this one, gonna wait till infinity wars 2.
This trailer gave me a Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Captain America, Superman, Batman, and Shazam vibe all in less than 2 minutes lol
i am a die hard marvel fan but got a bit disappointed with this trailer. i think marvel will fail to overpower or overcome dc wonder woman. the trailer shows she is doing all that what male characters have been doing in marvel since last 10 years. nothing different or exciting like gal gadot in wonder woman was. it will be simply another marvel movie with female in lead but doing exactly same things.
This is miscasting... I see she is weaker than black widow or wonder woman.
I was gonna ask why CM is a Female until i read that they are 2 different characters!
And that the villain of this movie is either an old woman or Captain Marvel
woman powerASS HOLES
Brie Larson looks like an elitist snob. Her actions in real life overshadow the part she’s playing. I won’t support some man hating feminist that uses race baiting tactics to divide us.
feminists will take advantage of this
Hope it's as good as Wonder Woman!
For example I find it really off putting when the only female member of a team is dressed in a mini skirt or hot pants.
Wait, the strongest character in the MCU is a woman?
And minority women of color were ignored when they reviewed movies
Im not what u think i am. Yea guys shes not a woman.
Captain marvel is a Female stop getting mad she a female...you sound stupid like Shazam is actually named Captain marvel in the D.C universe....but in marvel she’s a woman....like read comics people come on.
Now this looks awesome! I can't wait for this movie!! Here's to hoping it'll be just as good if not better than Wonder Woman!!!
Did she just hit the old woman?
I mean, it seems cool. But also it seems kind of forced. If marvel wants to make a movie about a female character, make one about Black Widow! Why do they just throw in this random superhero in when they could’ve brought in some one who we knew for almost 10 years? I just hope this movie is good.
I'm sure Feminists will go crazy about that but we can all agree granny is the more important topic
Wow, it was......... the most boring marvel trailer i've ever watch. Still prefer Wonderwoman
These movies all look exactly alike, and their trailers are even more generic. The same gimmicks when they use powers. The same little quips. The same cinematography. Here is another case of the Oscar winner being baited into a big budget spectacle. She is less emotive than Wonder Woman.
Brie Larson can suck a fat one...she's a useless feminist flag bearer and is unfit for the role!.
Captain Marverl VS Wonder Woman Who Win????
Let's hope for a true hero's journey, and not another "I'm the best from the beginning" super woman. 
I'm just happy to live long enough to be able to see a woman leading role in the MCU 😍❤
It doesn’t matter anymore as long as the lead is a woman and the movies shit is all that counts thesedays
Female super heroes should be banned
Nowhere close to Wonder woman 😄
b-but there is a female lead!!!1!
Another wonder woman movie so soon...
*punches old women*
@ 80% of this comment section, just say you hate women and leave
Yes a strong independent alien women is what the Avengers need to stop Rick Harrison, and his pawnshop
When she punched that old woman ;0
proceeds to punch an old woman in the face
The female superhero marketing falls flat because most audiences are sick of the forced agenda or just don't care. Plus Wonder Woman did it first.
when someone asks you 'Are you Wonder women?"
Me: "maybe your a feminist."
Females stepping into more traditionally masculine roles. But instead of celebrating femininity and all of the strength that it holds, they take on masculine traits. This is bad for both men and women. This should be offensive to females because they’re insinuating that the strong and positive traits that are intrinsic to femininity aren’t sufficient any more, and offensive to men because not only are women stepping into Male roles but they are also painting men in negative and incompetent light. •the sniper in Wonder Woman. •Homer Simpson. •Peter from Family Guy. •The father from Incredibles 2. This has been happening for years. It’s time for Men to stand up and retake masculinity whilst at the same time celebrating femininity. The TWO genders need to work together as we have done for hundreds of thousands of years to overcome adversity.
why MCU need a female superhero...captain marvel will fight Thanos without so much sacrifices as THOR and IRONMAN....captain america had....
Anyone predict this gonna cross wonder women or not WORLDWIDE
A male superhero could not get away with punching an old woman in the face. And they probably considered her punching a puppy or a child but decided against that to avoid controversy.
So we just gonna ignore the fact she punched an old woman 😂
This will  be super too and dc who just tries to copy marvel in movies everytime and trying to make a superwomen movie by kicking supermen out are going to be a huge flop again.
All the feminist creaming in there pants right know 😂
Trailer looks mediocre and obvious feminist angle is kringy.
And thus the decline of the MCU truly begins. Not because its a woman... because they are pushing a character that never made it popular in the comics, all to score brownie points with  people that are not even fans of the comics. Fans of the comics remember the most interesting storylines for Carol Danvers involve Rogue and the Xmen.... NOT the Avengers. Oh and seriously... 7 shots of her looking down then up directly at the camera with that "now its my turn" gaze... lazy.
So...  female Hal Jordan ?
This is why areana sings god is a woman
1:30 LOL i think see gonaa help the old women😂😂😂
People tagging on Brie Larson and the captain marvel character even when literally everyone movie in the past has been nothing short of absolutely great. Well, except the first two Thor movies, but he was justified and turned into something great with ragnarok. Phase 3 has been nothing but great movies and characters, and people doubting marvel now just because it’s a woman is really stupid
I'm taking my daughters because they like superhero's (not just the female ones but WW and Harley Quinn are their faves) so the trailer could have been garbage and I was still gonna go.... but damn this trailer was NOT a home run AT ALL.
Apparently being a black female air-force pilot is the norm. lol. Ridiculous.
Not even match to wonder women tralier .. my mind is now reading dc reality universe
Her voice sounds so high pitched and always looks angry. Oh, Brie Larson is a feminist. LOL
she punched an old woman WOW
Strong female lead punches old lady in the face.
Another super women...Another twist😍😍
Disappointed. I cringed when It said "HER"O I mean why I was fine till then. Never thought i'd be disappointed with Marvel. I am fine with female heros just don't make it stad out.
I watched the Wonder Woman trailer after this because that trailer wasn’t a let down.
Besides that, I'm concerned about the plot deviating on her childhood flashbacks. I really don't want to see more superheroes suffering from traumas in their childhood. Falling during your baseball game when you were 6 or watching a dead cat at 10 is not relevant. She is supposed to be badass, so editors: make her badass. Punching an old woman is not intimidating. I'm sure there are a couple of cool fighting scenes: take clips from them.
And then suddenly eson the searcher arrives from the sky  and flicks his finger decapitating  miss marvals head and saving the whole MCU from superman's female version trying to sabotage MCU.
Wonder Woman is better, just saying 😊
Sooooo Superman, but a woman?
So it's a woman who may or may not be from Earth with the superpower of looking mildly surprised when particle effects are happening around her.
2018, the only super power real women have is the ability to use the courts to take half of everything away from a man, Thanos style...
Damn Hope this gonna be great  like Wonder Woman
a girl. bro really why they make everything these day all about women, women should be equal to men and men should be equal to women, at this point women are just looking for empowerment
Feminist propaganda
*Waits for Wonder Woman 84*
Only the feminists would say this is a good movie cuz in reality captain marvel shouldn't have been played by a woman and this actress is boring.
Next trending is the captain Marvel costume for a woman and child.because she is the next superhero like wonder woman 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So when are they going to do a ghost busters on this and have a male Captain Marvel and a female Director Fury who is straight
Marvel should've just tried doing black widow movie if they were so much in need to do a female superhero movie. 
Already my favorite hero!!! I stan a strong female icon!! So happy marvek finally realised they had female characters still waiting on my shuri solo movie and an all marvel women team up...
Will not be seeing this feminist crap.
Did u guys noticed in the trailer she just punched an old woman how mean?? 😠😠
Well if this doesn't ooze politically correct nonsense I don't know what does.  Women's lib, anyone? LOL what a fail
Yes I've been waiting for this... My favorite female hero
But we got a female superhero solo movie which is great..
trailer is not so good.....but look so promising....I am still excited.... about captain marvel....and great move exact on women days...well played
I miss Wonder Woman....
I just don't care. There's nothing. I feel nothing. I was super hype for Wonder Woman, but this is...
I look forward to the movie wheres the woman's in her 50's, fat, flat and not blonde.
Square jaw...  female.....
Will Only see the movie for Samuel L. Jackson not for the brie Larson, no expression atall, love my wonder woman
Marvels Answer to Wonderwoman part 2 (both set in the 80s/90s)
Awe... More Feminist PC~SJW BS...Awe...And she'll kill Thanos all by herself when all of the Avengers are killed...Just by looking at him with her womany looks...What a load of BS lulz
ah theres a women in it gonna give this one a miss
Ahhh nothing like a marvel feminist movie 🎥 😂😂😂😂
1:30 is that wonder woman?
looks like a dc superwoman new season trailer :/
I'm all for a female super hero being really powerful and all that..but she seems kinda op :/
there feminists, happy
Unlike Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel has a body armor which *ACTUALLY COVERS HER BODY*
Did she just punch an old woman in the face?
The Future is Female
> To all the people saying this is "liberal feminist agenda": I'm sorry you didn't get your 10 superhero male protagonists this year, you will have to deal with 8-9. F*cking manbabies.
a hero dont punch oldwoman broooo
Captain Marvel is my favorite female superhero of all time and as much as I wanna like this trailer it looks kinda stale. And Bree Larson just *doesn't fit* as Carol Danvers if you've read her in the comics. Hopefully the next trailer will be better and she'll surprise me with her performance but I still feel that they could've cast someone better.
It was ok.  Not a bad trailer, but nothing special.  Didn't have the magic of the first Wonder Woman trailer.  I was moved by that and I wasn't moved by this.
Wowww, woman empowerment 😍😍😍😍😍❤️
I love Marvel and everything, but this is probably going to be the worst movie they've made after the Ant-Man movies. It's so disappointing because the first Marvel female super hero should get a fantastic movie. They should have done Black Widow first. This feels like Supergirl. 😐
Out of every female super hero who has the best introduction into a team? Like justice league or marvel or etc.
Nah,female heroes solo sucks
Super-Woman
Meh...So she's basically a poor man's Wonder Woman
*Melinda May MUST be in this movie!!!* Maybe as cameo! She was a long-time partner of Phil Coulson, you can't ignore her! Ming-na Wen doesn't even need make-up to look as a young woman:)
It took Marvel 11 years to make a female superhero movie while it took DC four.  CzechI'm not even a DCEU fanboy but wow, took them long enough.
The amount of people complaining or even questioning why she hits what appears to be an old woman shows why it can be so hard to present certain characters to a casual audience. without knowledge of source material, which a large amount of people who go to these movies do not have, its hard to understand the way these characters think. thats why its taken ten years of building characters to get to infinity wars. captain marvel should have had her movie a year or two ago in preparation for infinity war so that way we know why she wasnt IN it.
Inb4 feminists hijack this into their wahmen empowerment
I love how Marvel built up so much hype for female leads (like the Wasp or Gamora) in release trailers... and then they go an release this. Some Green Lantern's bride Netflix original looking sub 2-min snooze fest... Can't believe I'm witnessing Marvel s*** the bed here. This movie LOOKS stupid! What a god awful character choice to save the Avengers in IW2. I would MUCH rather have seen Adam Warlock played by Alexander Skarsgård or Dacre Montgomery or someone decent... or better yet... JUST THE OG AVENGERS YOU LEFT US WITH SINCE THAT WHAT INFINITY WAR LEFT US WITH AND WE HONESTLY ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH MISSING CHARACTERS AND STORY ARCS TO FOLLOW AT THE MOMENT.
What is the problem of punching a grandma in the face, when a lot of men and old men have been punch in the face by women and men superheroes and none complained about it.
Captain female is here
Captain feminist nazi marvel has arrived
We can’t really judge her job as Captain Marvel (general acting, facial expressions) until we watch the movie. I’m actually glad that they cut the trailer the way it is because her symbol is the last thing we saw in Infinity War. It’s not going to be a trailer with jokes and comedy like Ragnorok was. Remember that this woman has won an Oscar before so she’s clearly not terrible at acting. Surprised to see people so clearly expecting this movie to be bad considering NONE of you have seen it yet.
looks way better then wonder woman
Why does DC & Marvel copy each other? Isn't captain marvel a female version of Hal Jordon? Weren't they both Pilots? Weren't they both given alien powers? I wonder if rogue from the X-Men is going to steal Captain Marvel's powers and become the superpower Rogue like in the X-Men series since Disney now owns the rights to the X-Men that's a whole nother story line for Disney & Marvel.
Eh expected more lmao, they really pushed the fact that she's a women in my opinion, which I have no trouble with at all
She is not beautiful as I thought. Compare Wonder Woman...!!!
Just cause you’re a girl doesn’t mean its ok to punch an old woman. Also, flat butt
after she don t smile.....better sure Wonder Woman is 100 to 1....hot and great woman.....
Why is it a woman and not a man wtf????
I cant wait to see the new catwoman movie its a big hairy guy.
the look of brie larson is not very strong....personally I think most of the mcu fans will not like her after seeing the movie...Morever, Her face is too much cute...and I think cute face is not completely adjust with a superhero persinality.....MCU should cast a good looking woman for that character not a cute looking
The woman she punched was a skrull
This is kickass and all, but I can't help but wonder what the context was behind Captain Marvel getting into a fistfight with an old lady. Seriously, that woman got sucker punched so hard she flew right into the next Avengers movie. If she takes any more hits she'll be so far in the future that DC might have a good movie out by the next time we see her.
Female Green Lantern Knockoff
This cast is not good, brie Larson really has a dead facial expression, even you guys say it is like terminator movie cuz she is brainwashed, is she gonna be the same face for the next two movies, the character is supposed to be a badass . Let's hope this doesn't suck cuz it's the first female standalone movie in this marvel cinematic universe.
Green Lantern but with a feminist actress that won't be likeable at all...
help the feminists are taking over!
1:30 wonder woman vs captain marvel
she's so beautiful and strong.  hmm premiere scheduled for March 8. it's International Women's Day. 
They are gonna have to work overtime to make this movie seem like a big deal and a must-see event.  Because this trailer didn't do that.  Neither does Brie Larson here.  I know people want to stay away from the Wonder Woman comparisons and her vs Gal, but one thing Gal has over Brie by spades is her face acting. That is what sold me on Wonder Woman a lot.  Brie just doesn't capture the same kind of face acting and emoting that gets me invested.  And the trailer doesn't do that either as well as screwing up her origin story.    
Marvel know how to do female characters
Trying to achieve wonderwoman level. This movie wont please me. ill rather put all my hopes on Venom.
ew weak female superhero movie boring..
Then there's that one feminist in the comments saying "you go girl!!!"
Hyper feminism ACTIVATED! She is strong, she is the swiss army man, she is an ace pilot, she has got balls….baseballs. The dawn of ultra feminism has arrived. This movie is a restricted area for male genital, man not allowed to enter. World of Captain Female, where men are the endangered species!
1:38 that's Batman from BvS!!! and i'm sorry, i'm a Marvel fanboy but Wonder Woman >>> MISS Marvel
Where’s my Black Widow trailer?!?  If ya gonna do a female character at least do one that we want to see.
these people talking about captain marvel hitting an old woman don't know shit about the villain just some people following a trendy thing so they can fit in ans don't get left behind by society
wow for real noone cares this isnt even the real story of the female captain marvel this is trash
Wonder woman ..woo! 
Seems like marvel is trying to show diversity. Black people and woman.
Clearly not the plot and personality everyone hoped to expect. Gal Gadot did 1000x better and was so charming as a woman and powerful as a hero. Thought this would be an intro to an amazing human/hero. Anyway, this movie will rip the **** out at the box office so no producer, investor and so on would care that much.
Look it looks good but I'm still expecting crap. I mean out of all characters why Captain Marvel and why not the guy version "Nothing against women" idk just a opinion
Ewww, could have done with a better effect for the space stuff since Captain Marvel is all about the space. I really liked the casting, costume design, the fact that It wasn't in the same timeframe as the other films and that it was doing Skrulls as well.The portrayal of Captain Marvel herself though seems kinda unlikeable aswell, but I guess that could change in the film- thought the same thing about Wonder Woman to be fair, I think they just put all the Stone-faced Badass stuff in the trailers rather than the character stuff. Also why are trailers still using that same score?
It looks like this movie has been influenced by the Wonder woman movie which is a shame because Carol Danvers in the comics is a very compelling character to whom many people can identify with as she lives trying, and many times failing, to be a good person while dealing with her, sometimes even existencial, problems.
Brie Larson is a miss for me. People complained that Gal Gadot was too skinny to portray Wonder Woman, but Gal Gadot was able to capture the persona/spirit on Wonder Woman very well. But here, I see Brie Larson in cosplay, not Captain Marvel. She just doesn't look like she has that "it" factor". Her voice is wooden and monotone. I think she was a miscast for this role. 
This is the real movie of SuperDuper Women......
"Maybe we can sneak into a Marvel movie to see what all the hoopla is all about, we'll pose as a elderly woman." - DC
From what it appears in this trailer it looks EPIC. Glad to see more female comic characters come to life. Women empowerment! ✊
Took Marvel long enough for a female lead movie.
Great women superhero
This movie's theme of "war on the elderly" is a bold move; I'll admit, I am intrigued. (Kindly don't bother "nerd-splaining" what the old woman LIKELY is; I sincerely don't care, and the war-on-the-elderly theme would ONLY SAVE THIS MOVIE.)
Wonderwoman is better...
Honestly there should be no female superheroes, only male. Female superheroes make women think they're as strong as men when they really aren't
Finally a female movie
This isn't a sexist issue. Male actors get criticized for lacking emotion. The new superman people hated for no smiling. Wonder Woman was a hit with everyone. A female lead superhero. Marvel, don't be Star Wars. Marvel Fans who cry sexism. Don't be Star Wars fans who cry sexism. This is how you break a franchise. Star Wars is proof that you are never too big to fail.
This feminist's gonna ruin marvel
"She's too OP just because she's female"
DC has Wonder Woman and Marvel has Captain Marvel who would win the fight.
Wonder woman ripoff
Rogue, She-Hulk, Jean Grey, Storm, Spider-Woman, Jubilee, Silver Sable...  How come I never heard of Captain Marvel.....
So no one's gonna talk about the fact that she punches an Old Woman? Lol
So Captain Marvel is a woman now?
This movie not original, why......Wonder Woman  :D She's cool superhero not captain marvel or miss marvel? i don't know
A very Wonder Woman trailer. I love it! Especially the last scene
Captain marvel hit a old woman
This is awesome but I kind of feel bad that Captain Marvel got to be the first Marvel woman to have a lead movie than Black Widow. I mean, there are tons of story about her like how she grew up, how did she and Hawk Eye work together before, how he trained the Winter Soldier, her past romance and how she end up working for Tony and a lot more. But yeah, Marvel said there will be a Black Widow movie but yeah, enough said.
What's she like as a wife and helping her man like women were invented for in the first place?
Compare this to the Wonder Woman trailer,  and this one looks awfully bland and generic. Gal Gadot looked liked a warrior/soldier who was fierce, compassionate and a badass. Brie Larson looks uninterested tbh
*Your friend, Captain Marvel, was kicked from the server for slapping an old woman in the face*
But for me this movie will be not better then wonder woman!!!
wonder woman ?🤔
Wonder Woman from DCEU was nurturing, feminine, heroic, innocent, and a bit naive but still badass...... here, Cap Marvel looks like she's bored the whole time.
So you like kicking butts do ya? Well we'll show you old woman!
This chick better do a badass role in the movies, I simply do not approve of a woman killing thanos.
So basicly cool women vs white supremacist plot again ? Star wars flashes all over again :-O idk idk
Turn back now. 60% of these comments are trolls complaining about her facial expression and tone of voice, which happens any time there's a woman in the public sphere.
hmm the women captain marvel? seriously? we talk about feminism issue here?
RIP wonder woman v:
Captain Marvel was a man first, this is just pc bollox, maybe if they start giving men female superhero titles, then i will accept its done for equality. REAL EQUALITY!!!!
Wonder Woman 😭 crying  🚫👼
Y did she slap that old woman
That Old lady was Wonder Woman
After 20 Marvel movies and 9 lead male actors, it will be refreshing seeing a lead female actor in her first own Marvel film. 
I hope this turns out fantastic. I hope this breaks records as a New Black Panther for women. I hope it’ll be remembered. This trailer though....not a fan.
No-one seemed to have an issue with the excellent Wonder Wonder film, with an superb choice of leading star and director,  and it's questionable if the Superman character is even stronger than her. Several female characters in the Marvel's official canon (such as Phoenix and even the Scarlet Witch) are already as powerful, if not more powerful than people like Thor (does anyone have a problem with that?). This production, and the media beat-up about it seem like some last-minute, half-baked attempt at pushing forth some kind of social agenda on the loyal Marvel fans. Brie Larson also appears to have learnt her craft at the Hayden Christensen School of Method Acting.
Lol captain marvel sounds like a 7-year old girl trying to sound like a woman
perhaps this time you will not belittle men and uplift women.
Of course Issa woman
This movie scares me. It took them too long to make this trailer especially since they almost finished the movie by the time they made the trailer (which ironically they usually are only partly done with the movie when a trailer comes out). Not to mention the trailer they did make is mediocre at best and pandering at worst with the whole "her" message. We get it. Women can be superheroes. Stop trying to use feminism to sell your tickets, it's gross. I hope the film isn't a disaster that panders on the whole "women can be heroes" shit as the main theme. It's overplayed and it's 2018. We have had plenty of strong ass women already like Mystique, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Storm, Jean Grey, the head of the Wakandan military in Black Panther, Wonder Woman, yada yada. I want something new. Something not the norm. Black Panther had some pretty leet fight scenes especially with the Rhino mounts and a killer soundtrack. The twist with Infinity Wars also spiced shit up. Lets hope this movie is not Christian Stewart 2.0 looking constipated and talking about her new monster girl form for two and a half hours.
wonder woman marvel version??😂😂😂
Woah it's wonder woman
Wonder woman vs Captain Marvel at the box office.
Brie Larson has the model for this generation, thanks that we have one more woman can do anything
A woman superhero movie? Nobody going to enjoy that feminist movie
I can't wait that we have another female hero, and I can't wait to see her around for a while with the other avengers!
This does not excite me at all.  This is no Wonder Woman.   Next trailer better have something for me to want to go to the movies.
*Punches elderly woman in the face*
First woman producer for marvel movies
I mean what more can you do after Wonder Woman and another Origin story right after the epic Infinity War
Black panther:get this woman a Thanos
Capitana feminista
Hopefully this wont be a superman 2.0 as woman :/
People become aggresive because the hero is female.  Dont be offend as it is the fact. Most people would be love if the hero is a male than a female.
What since when has captian marvel been a women???? Pc gone completely mad
I think the fight for 'equality' and equal rights has been accomplished if you're complaining about female butts in video games and how much time females smile in movies..
Promising female lead movie but not gonna replace rdjr.
Judging by the 31k dislikes, it seems there’s definitely a selection of individuals in that particular  group whose male egos are threatened by the very image of a strong female superhero in the MCU leading her own film. Not saying that all 31k of them are composed of such individuals but judging by the comments I’ve seen through the day and night, it wouldn’t surprise me if 2/3s of the dislikes came from males predominantly straight and white who are threatened that their all male MCU is changing. 
But she is a woman, so society are happy. XD
She beat iron man to a pulp in the comics. I will never support this woman.
Did she hit a old woman??? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Thanos has no chance
Now THIS is a female superho. non of that micro mini skirt nonsense
she is like a superman in woman's body..
She punched old woman..what captain?!
RIP my feelings for Wonder Woman
I don't know man, something about it feels very DCU (in terms of movies not characters, maybe green lantern-ish). It feels like they're going for a serious/inspiring woman story but that only works if a character has a likeable personality. Otherwise people won't care how "inspiring" your actions are, which evidently happened to Superman in the DCU. Wonder Woman was good bc outside of the heroics you saw a nicer more intriguing personality. Only a trailer but for the love of god please give her a likeable personality and not only a heroic woman personality. And if they're going for a cool looking expressionless character they need to do a better job in the costume/makeup department to give her an heroic mystique bc rn it looks like a a slightly amped up tv show.
Just because she's a lead female hero doesn't necessarily make it a feminist movie. Stop being so offended and just enjoy it for what it is, another great Marvel movie.
She punched an old woman
I am so scared for this movie. I they are doing the thing I didn't her do be. All stubern and ruthless but also the most powerful. I really hope they don't make her just a Mary Sue. Hopefully it will be like Wonder woman where she is still super strong, but also humble with herself
A woman is not a "hero"
I hope they’ve given her a good script. I’ve seen too many female leads being put in a leading role and advertised like crazy but when it came down to it the actors didn’t have enough to work with. 
I can't wait for Wonder Woman 2
Me: Oh look! Another Wonder Woman movie!
The right is going to hate this movie.  Strong female character as the hero.
You really need models not great actress to sell a Woman in CBM ?? 🤔 Gal is not a great actress but she has a presence plus wW trailer was much better edited
And Wonder woman is the best female superhero.
Boy it was funny to watch her punch that old woman. No context, or explanation. Just her beating an old woman. Nice job.
this would be the Marvel's best superhero female.......
I’m curious now, she seems like has amnesia, so was the woman with the chip in her head in doctor strange a reference to her.
super women....again.....so boring
The ONLY reason im watching this is for the end credits just to get that extra 30 seconds to see what will be happening after the aftermath of Thanos... otherwise id wait till this hits a stream site in HD 3-4 months from when its released and watch it there. Smh enough with these female leads. Also the original Captain Marvel was a MAN i would prefer not being bamboozled next time.  Carol Danvers is MS MARVEL not CAPTAIN MARVEL idc what those new age comic says the only comics that matter are the ones with STAN LEES name on it that used to sell for 30-50 cents.
Captain Marvel or Wonder Woman? Who would win
ohh great another feminist movie, ill pass
Don't mind me, just here to downvote this feminist trash.
Wait, isn’t she the first female Marvle Super hero!? NICE!!!
women are not soldier, or brave...its a ballsy mans job!
This is just the Marvel's version of Wonder Woman so all the feminists out there can shut their mouth about the lack of female superheroes. They will make this woman kill Thanos so they can finally stop crying.
I bet that old woman deserved to be punched
Wonder woman or Captain Marvel???
Oh look, it's Green Wonder Lantern Woman!
this movie sucks and is for feminists to jerk themselves off
Seem like they're leaning heavily into the fact she's a women...which doesn't bode well.. teaser was dull... hopefully the next one will give me something to get hype for...also keep the mystery of the Skrill
It’s no Wonder Woman though
Those saying “captain marvel punched an old lady”, that “old lady” was most likely a skrull. Deviant Skrulls have pointed ears, corrugated chins, green skin. Most males are bald and have no facial hair. Females have full head of hair. Most Skrulls are physically malleable, able to alter their shape size, and/or color at will. Hope this helps
Wonder Woman had a better trailer tbh. I’m still excited to see this! I hope it’s good!
this look like this will be better than Wonder Woman
Looks boring, so I'm gonna pass. Probably just gonna shove 90s nostalgia down the throats of the viewer and push a feminist narrative.
You can really tell who has read the comics and who hasn't going through these comments. So many times I was internally screaming because of what I saw. No Captain Marvel isn't a good ball of happy go lucky but she does have a few moments where she loosens up. And if you couldn't tell this movie is going to have "funny moments" that most mcu fans are use to when she punched an elderly woman in the face.... Actually she might think that old lady was a Skrull.
“We have no idea what threats are out there. We need you.” This is what men in countries that don’t educate their women don’t understand.
This feels like a cheap Netflix feminist show
Captain Marvel is feminist propaganda that with ruin the MCU. She’ll be a Mary Sue, I guarantee it.
I really hope that old woman wasnt a skrull
Maybe the first marvel movie in the new phases not to do a comedy. That's pretty good. Hope it's as good as wonder woman.
Hands down better than that shitty wonder woman movie
we live in a take down culture where our only goal as a society is to tear women in lead roles apart. People body slammed Gal Gadot in the first Wonder Woman trailer and casting, People tried to bring up dirt on her to smear her name. People tried to smear Jodi Witakers name for playing the Doctor in Doctor who. People body slam and shame Daisy Ridley in Star Wars. and now theres people body slamming Brie Larson and questioning her ability to act, despite her already having an academy award. This society does not support women in film.
_Discover what makes a hero_ *proceeds to punch an elderly woman the second right after*
Trailer starts off with a woman crashing her ride....typical. =P
so... captain marvel is a woman? welp that's a twist
We'll Finally find out what makes a real feminist, oops i meant HER-O
the shittiest marvel trailer ever... can clearly see they are motivated by wonder woman...
LMAO! Butthurt DC fanboys are always out in force ready to trash everything that comes out of Marvel. And when the movie comes out, they are also among the first in line in buying tickets and would secretly agree that MCU movies are way way way way way way better than Green Garbage, Man Of Sh!t, Murder Man vs Super Emo, Suicide Crap, and Justice Lag combined. Although I did love Nolans' Batman trilogy, enjoyed the fairly recent Wonderwoman, and kinda liked the action in Man Of Sh!t (sorry that movie is average at best). Overall, Marvel is just superior with an arsenal of very relatable and fun heroes. No offense, I used to be a DC fan as a kid but gravitated towards Marvel when I found out about Spider-Man, Wolverine, X-Men, The Hulk, Daredevil, The Punisher, and Deadpool. I am just being brutally honest specially nowadays when DCtards loves spoiling the movies (with additional dishonest comments) on almost every internet forums out there. Just stop guys, DC will soon be a part of Marvel once Disney buys WB 20 years from now. XD
Don't get me wrong I like both MCU and DCU, but somehow Wonder Woman had better first impression than this 😐
Feminists taking over games and movies these days.
The only exciting part about this movie is Samuel L Jackson, Blockbuster, and Clark Gregg. I was expecting Captain Marvel to kick ass and take names - stoically. Instead she is portrayed wimpy and lame. Emotionless in the wrong way, not the cool way. And her hair, while she looking very beautiful, would look so much better cut off. Possibly when she fights Thanos she will cut her hair? I really love this actress though. She is awesome. I hope the newer trailers will change my mind. As someone who is supposed to fight against Thanos, I was expecting something far better than Iron Man or Thor. I guess expecting a strong, fierce personality like Wonder Woman from Captain Marvel was my mistake.
As neither a Marvel or DC fanatic - this trailer doesn't evennnnn come close to Women Woman's Comic Con trailer. That one actually got me hyped up to see the movie.
Remember kids only women with no breasts are normal bodies
I like it. I felt more hype when I first saw WW, but this looks great. Marvel took it time, but they finally got their female superhero with a leading role.
"The future is female" cuz revisionism
This movie is going to be either one of two things: An overpowered misandristic movie or a similar formula to “Wonder Woman”.
I get that you're trying to appeal to feminists, but captain marvel was never a very interesting character in comics either
She hits an old lady. Boycott this movie. It’s ok to hit women?????
Looks complete TRASH! And casted exactly how we thought !! Out of all the women you could pick that’s who was chosen ! I’ll pass looks so horrible !
Looks like female green lantern
Wonder woman was better than this bullshit
Run Wonder Woman ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnnnnnnnnnnnnnn😱
Wonder woman.... You just got a competition.....!!!
Yikes, a character with no personality has amnesia and needs to rediscover their past. It is nearly impossible to make this type of movie interesting or memorable. For a Marvel movie, it also has a distinct lack of action and effects, people who just want a flashy action flick are probably disappointed too. As far as the whole "female" thing goes, the reason people have a stigma against female characters is that of saltine garbage like this.
Why she pushing to old woman?
oh look, another movie with a 100 lb woman throwing people throw walls and shit. No thanks.
Captain marvel punching an old woman
When you trigger a feminist 1:48
I don't like how there are rumors going around that she's going to be the savior in Infinity War 4. I get that they will need her help, but at this point compared to to the OG Avengers she's done absolutely nothing. If anybody should be the savior it should be somebody from the main team. I get that Marvel is trying to compete with Wonder Woman but come on stop overhyping her so much
1:31 y did she hit that old women 
Far better than wonder woman.hit like if you agree
Captain Marvel. Really? Out of all Marvel characters. Pick ANY female Marvel Character but Captain Marvel? Sigh....
It seemed fine until 1:26 - 1:28 opened with "HER" to emphasize that SHE is a hero. Not a HE. GET IT? IT'S A WOMAN. TOTALLY FIRST IN THE HISTORY OF CINEMA. IN THE HISTORY OF COMIC BOOK MOVIES. You're late to the party, Marvel. pushing out OP female character doesn't break any new grounds, but it makes it seem like you're having some sort of feminist agenda lurking behind otherwise promising character.
i dont wanna be seem sexist after all the feminist stuff being said to this work but, so far, this is the crappiest trailer I've ever watched from marvel
After captain marvel : did you know there was a film called wonder woman
not even near wonder woman lmao
I thought Captain Marvel is a Man. It's like GhostBusters. Why Women Superiority so Much.
did she just punch an elder woman?
The female super hero
Well...after pushing feminist agendas with this movie and after the comments of Brie Larson about white critics you could expect a good first trailer at least but I think marvels goal for this movie is to disappoint fans from the get go
Why did she punch that old women
Can you all just appreciate that this is their first trailer for it? Of course it's not gonna blow us away quite yet, Marvel would never spoil the movie for us. Stop being so pessimistic about this movie, you can't judge it based on a teaser trailer. And for those who are complaining about Brie Larson- her being Captain Marvel and the fact that she's a woman? It's from the comics, of course she's a woman. And if you don't trust Marvel's choice to cast Brie as Captain Marvel, I'd like to see you all name someone better. Just wait to watch the goddamn movie before being so pessimistic and making a judgement.
The best female superhero movie of all time.
I think that old woman is the villan
CAPTAIN Marvel is a Woman ... WTF
Comparing her to Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Thor, Iron Man, Wonder woman, x-men, avengers, ant-man, heck even Aquaman... I know all of them... But it's the first time i hear of HER.
Rip Wonderwoman..!
I saw an assault on white aged heterosexual woman <---   )
Oh so it's like Black Panther except pandering to women this time instead of the negros.  All politics no substance.  Sounds like this movie will be worth the price of free.
people love anything with a woman in 2018. The lead of this movie shows no emotion, no facial expressions, no energy. The trailer is a hodge podge of nothingness. This is boring and generic.  Brie Larson is 100% not believable as a superhero or fighter pilot, much less the most powerful being in the universe.
Badass!!! I’m so happy she’s the first woman to have this role in marvel
What if that old woman is one above all??
Wonder Woman hyped me more
she hits an old woman... i love it
She has feminist power
2018: *Some superhero casually punches an old woman in the bus
punched an elderly woman for no reason
In case your lost about 1:31, the old woman is a Skull. Skrulls are an alien species with the ability to shapeshift into any person.
Nada como wonder woman lo siento
I’m so happy she’s a woman.
So Wonder Woman 2 is copying this? A female superhero film set in the 1980s?
Please, no feminist agenda.
Everyone in this film looks boring, except Phil Coulson. Nick Fury is always boring in every film, pompous & obsessed with European women, it seems.
Please be an awesome superhero movie with as little feminist bullshit as possible.
I thing captain marvel better than wonder women  ...................loooool
All this woman hero shit!
Wonder Woman 2: electric boogaloo
A women super hero movie with a men's face. Whao!
Yeah, feminists, first you ruin Star Wars. Now you start your rage against Marvel.
 it will better than wonder woman 
Stop shoe-horning women into men's super-hero characters. Stop it! Stop it!  Stop it! It is so vile and untrue. In the beginning in the comic books there weren't that many female heroes. I won't go to see this. As in comic books so it is in real life it is men who do the miraculous, the impossible, the unbelieveably fantastic, not women. They only come in scavenge, and if they can..., lie and try to take the glory of doing it.
Compare this trailer to dc'wonderwoman
Go, girl! Males are simps and unworthy slaves! Women are the goddesses and the only hope of humanity!!!!!!
Why does she crack an old woman upside the head?? "The hero we've been waiting for!" Lol
sounds like another woman power movie, with a story arc so boring you would fall asleep after five minutes. not impressed in the slightest
Old lady: Hello dear, are you Wonder Woman?
1:27 you can almost TASTE the tears of anti-feminists
Why did she just straight up slump that old woman like that??
"Wonder Woman: The Marvel Version (See what we did there?)"
I'm curious. Don't know who the character is, I only know some KREE connections or ties whatever. Mcu sure needs a female lead solo movie but I wanted to see a black widow movie before this second row character. Only comic readers know her.
A superhero woman? 
Cap Marv. : Who’s the best female superhero huh?
Let’s hope they sell it on its own merits and not as some gender empowering masterpiece. Wonder Woman and Aliens were great movies that stand on their own merits. Marvel should have the courage to do the same with Captain Marvel.
Wasn't Captain Marvel a dude? I'm not talking about Shazam from the DC universe but Marvels Captain Marvel, I swear I've seen some comic books somewhere and it shows Captain Marvel as a blonde haired man not a woman I might be wrong but can someone explain?
You Know They Firing Shots At When DC When They Have The Same Concept As “Wonder Woman.” Tbh I HOPE THIS GOES HIGHER THAN WONDER WOMAN. Image Captain Marvel Dissing DC in Future Interviews 
1.40is she batwoman
Rip WonderWoman
...i dont like her voice, at least they arent going the feminist route with this.
I think Captain Marvel really hates person who has wrinkly face just like the old woman she punched because the Skulls have wrinkly faces so that's why she punched the old woman but she didn't meant to punch the old woman or maybe she punched the old woman because Captain Marvel scan and observe her closely
I thought a woman hero is called a heroine?
"I'm not what you think I am."  No, you're definitely NOT the Phoenix, which is the real strongest female character in the comics Marvel Universe!"  That aside, i still love watching her incredible power up at the end!  I have to say that this trailer is actually really great!
Music from Turkish Woman;) (ingilizce hatam varsa pardon)
Also, just because her voice sounds girly, she can’t be badass? Y’all are forgetting women can be more than one thing.
A perfect movie for feminists !
This woman lacks, fluidity, edge, she is so.... stiff. What more is there to her beneath CGI, maybe if she was funny.. Not exciting.
She is the woman who is gonna change everything
They've marketed this as "the future is female". Will definitely not pay a single dime to watch this movie.
negative comments because the protagonist super hero is a female... end of story. no matter how good the film ends up being, everyone will still "hate" it. Why? because women cant be winners in their eyes.
Oh wow wonderful another movie filled with  idiotic liberal propaganda, yeah disney people are going to love seeing another Mary Sue save the day because that worked out so well for star wars. No thanks ill skip this trash i don't want to go the cinema when its filled with land whales (aka feminists) and soy boys (aka low t male feminists or buzzfeed fans) . Ill stick to the classics like  the dark knight,  X2, hell boy 1 & 2 etc.
4k dislikes from wonder woman fans
So its ok for a women to punch a grandma.....???????...Maybe a Skrull I don't know.
Never send a woman to do a Marvel's job.... Wait. Never mind.
disgusting to see a women had highleted in this worlds famous infinity war
So all in all, I think this was a good teaser. I can only imagine what the official trailer will have for us. I am a tad bit concerned about Brie Larson's lack of facial expressions. Come on Marvell, you cannot screw this up for you, me and most importantly all of your legions of fans. Let this be Marvel's version of Wonder Woman.
Wtf?! Why would they put a scene of her punching an old woman?? 😂
Boring trailer and this is obviously another agenda movie to “empower” women like Wonder Woman. Brie Larson looked bored and uncomfortable in this trailer. Marvel turned the Hulk into a wimp so they can build up Captain Marvel and make a female save the day. I’ll skip this in theaters and wait for a rental.
its a feminist movie straight up. a movie doesn't have to have what is essentially a cinematic essay on gender roles to be feminist. it merely having a lead female character is a feminist thing in itself, especially considering that this is the first female lead female after a decade of marvel making male dominated and lead character films. so hate to break it you, but yes, it is a feminist movie :) there's plenty of excited women AND fanboys who are going to love it if you don't
Superheroes are meant to be men as they are tough keep fighting back never give up attitude we already have Wonder Woman movie it hard to watch another female dominating superhero movie I will skip this one before infinity war 2
Shes probably not identified as a female because not minority. Actual female problems.
WonderWomen > Captain Marvel!
So marvel finally scheduled a movie for a female super hero finally after ages
Montage of cute white woman's face, no action scenes.
Awful, Wonder Woman continues to reign supreme.
Not a DC hater but trust me this will make Wonder Woman look like shit.
i think the reason why this trailer doesn't really excite me is because of the fact it's about a white female.. like i want to see something Unique and different. but still im eager to see the first reviews about this movie and see if it's worth ma time :P
I really hope that old woman wasn’t a skrull
Punches an elderly woman. The hero that will beat thanos...
Wow she punched an old woman, SO EPIC!
Me, a woman: You promise to be good?
Ok I don't know much about this kind of stuff but when I played mortal combat vs dc captain marvel was a guy , why did they change it to a female?or was it always a female
Wonder woman is going down
Sweet maybe we’ll get a good female superhero movie....(looks at Wonder Woman) stiiiillll hoping....
Eh it’s going to be better than Wonder Woman.
Wonder woman of marvels.i dont like any woman as a centered superhero.either on DC or marvels.but JEAN GREY beats all this woman superhero while JEAN GREY is just a mutant and just a part of x-men.
Expressionless superwoman
I dont like female superheroes movies
Completely representive of what our culture wants, down with males, turn them into to politically correct and trendy females punching hero's. All for money.
I don't like when marvel decides to put women as heros they are just not enjoyable compared to men
I don't care how many tickets this film sells. It still doesn't change the fact that Disney is promoting feminism through feminist Brie Larson just like Disney promoted feminism through feminist Emma Watson in The Beauty and the Beast. 
*crossed fingers* don't be feminist, don't be feminist
You know just because it's a female superhero doesn't mean it has to make the entire movie about feminazi agendas-
1:30 did she just slap an old woman ?
Wonder Woman vs Captain Marvel??
The skrulls look lame. And captain marvel is an extremely boring character.  This movie is going to be a dumpster fire.  It will under perform.  Hey Marvel, just because Wonder Woman did well doesnt mean your lame female lead character movie will.  Wonder Woman is an iconic character, Captain marvel is not.
In later news: woman boycotts Marvel due to child punching grandmother in the face.
*Why the hell she punched the old woman*
Bruh her voice is so annoying I can just see the feminist memes coming for “ I’m not what you think I am “ like tf you gon do call me a fuckboy in a group chat 💀
how to make money .....write a bs script ...hire unworthy actresses / actors ...relate the shit somehow to feminism and all the brainless fat women will come shouting          ' future is female '.. a trend has started to push and make women superheroes and they all are a big fail.
Feminist cringe
why did she punch the old woman at 1:30
Dead ass trailer its going to be as meh as wonder woman. Im just excited to see more Fury.
Looks like the female version of a mix between doctor strange and the green lantern XD
After seeing this for the second time, I can tell why some commenters are dissing or not liking the trailer as much,  I dont think it gives Captain Marvel the credit she deserves, being the first female superhero movie for mcu, it is not interesting enough in the plot and the actor Brie does look a little bored, I will say this trailer feels like more about Nick Fury than anything because he is narrating most of what goes on and only hear Brie Larson aka Captain Marvel talk a bit but never hear what she has to say about her own story or life becoming a hero. Plus much of the scenes jump around to much to give specific details on her story. My point being this trailer could have been a bit better, either way I am still going to see it cuz its Marvel and everthing will come together once i see it
i cant wait for people to compare her to wonder woman *insert sarcasm here*
Oh wow a strong independent female in a mans world with just enough hot to get fanboys hard but not enough to upset sjw’s?
I hope Marvel learns something from Star Wars. If this turns into a Feminist agenda it will ruin Marvel.
Approved by feminists
Did she just hit an old woman?!😢
boring another "feminist" in town that didn't do anything to beat the aliens suddenly becomes so OP that can beat thanos? female hero is so boring.. i want to watch live action powerpuff girls instead.
The smell of Hollywood progressive/Mary Sue/feminist bullshit is strong with this one.
Everyone is mad about this movie. Me? I'm just glad to finally have a female lead superhero movie.
Really? You guys already had a female Captain Marvel. Her name was Miss Marvel. Stop being politically correct and ruining these heroes
R.I.P. Wonder Woman.
anyways, if y'all are hissing and bitching about Carol punching the old woman, the lady is actually a Skrull, a shapeshifting alien. basically these ugly looking clones of Mystique.
Well technically this is not a female led superhero.  As she gets merged together with Jude laws character, so she is half man.
I don't get it. Why is Wonder Woman in a Marvel movie? Isn't she from DC? Oh well. This should make for an exciting crossover movie!
honestly i expecting more but this is actually so good, cant wait to see another female heroes in mcu
Okay! This trailer was not exciting at all, and it's not because captain marvel is a woman, it's because she has the same boring expressions everytime in the trailer. So, angry feminists should get a life.
Marvel AND D.C Fanboys don't hate but, Wonder Woman was a better movie.
This felt like a teaser trailer. Wonder Woman did it better.
When she beat the old women i couldn’t stop laughing *im a monster i know*
Yeah we needed more women heros. NO Captain Marvell was never a woman.
Marvels sucks DC Stand for definitely cooler than marvel also Brie Larson sucks as a superhero women should stay in the kitchen
This movie and d actress will have a direct comparison with wonder woman nd Gal gadot.
It must be: The God of Thunder >>>> Woman with Alien's powers
Looks like a female green lantern movie. Yikes.
The trailer looks bland and the protagonist looks bored. theres no personality or anything unique about her. im down with it being serious but cmon she seem so bored and bland. and it pisses me off when "Women" pull the gender card. no we criticise the movie BECAUSE we want it to be great and amazing not just "oh no boobs? ill go bash rock together to make fire" im glad they are integrating her into the MCU and i hope when it comes out ill be able to say "This movie is awesome"
wow this will win "the movie for crazy drunk feminist with most likes award"
I mean jeez we know women can do what man can do also, relax take a tampon eat some chocolate
For Aquaman, Shazam and  Wonder Woman 84.
Did Captain Marbel just hit an old women?
MEH another feminist story
Um... watched this advert for your product, and am choosing not to invest time and money on this. Will happily save it for Wonder Woman 1984. 
I Just Thank For Captain Marvel is White women.
niceiii. this trailer is already better than the wonder woman movie
1:31 how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old woman?
First trailer, fine ok. Think it was bland, but Ill go see it. Would be cooler of wonder woman was in it lol
all ready better than that trash Wonder Women movie
cool they done a women hero caz all i see is man hero's :)
Gynowashing established male archetypal characters from popular culture, thereby adopting stylized masculine traits and behaviors as feminine ideals, isn't only as bad as all other types of cultural appropriation, blackface traditions and Hollywood's habit of whitewashing characters originally conceived as other ethnicities, it's even worse as it posits a role model for girls and young women that most adult women would find radically conflicting with their temperament and emotional preferences if they ever tried adopting it... You may not agree with this now, but you will eventually. Many people also enjoyed seeing blackface musicians in the era of the minstrel plays and didn't see anything wrong with it.
I don’t care if she’s a women bury make her movie incredible with a good story. If they make this just a femenism movie for money I’m gonna be dissapointed
Shit! It’s gonna be one of “those” movies! It will flop on box office and the feminists will blame ‘toxic men’ for the bad movie
I thought captain marvel was a guy in the comics why is captain marvel a female?
batman is the only person who can stop this women. 😤 (no cap)
1:27 At least Wonder Woman was subtle about it
Finally a female super hero movie that doesn’t look corny, movie looks good
Oh no the feminists are taking over who shoots we call
God I’m just praying for a female marvel character that has a personality
This movie will follow the same drone formula of the other Marvel movies the old lady is some shape shifting alien and we'll get some rushed and jumbled Captain Marvel back story that will absolutely include her overcoming some type of bullying. It will be chock full of girl power cliches that will probably be more insulting than empowering. I see it doing far less than Wonder Woman.
I think it will be no 1 women superhero movie great love😍😍😍
Eeh, and this woman is supposed to take the Avengers over the hump to beat Thanos? Hard to believe, even in a comic book universe. I'd rather see Thor head to head with Thanos, he beat that ass with Stormbreaker.
she's be a feminist idol for marvel fans.
EA should start taking notes, this is how you make a strong woman
She is ugly :P Wonder woman is hotter then Captain Marvel .
Looks like another wonder woman. I thought marvel would come with a lot more realistic movie.
Marvel version of wonder woman
This movie can't beat wonder woman movie
Two words.. Feminist Garbage.
This looks so awful lmao. I swear the women characters are so boring.
Oh yeah! Marvel is now throwing an over powered female character at us. I have no interest in this. Who are they marketing with this? I don't understand why push these crazy overpowered women at us when all the women I know don't care about these action movies and I have to pull my wife to them. I don't get it
This is Piece of shit(captain marvel) coming soon in 2019.😂..  am waiting for wonder women 2💓
Wonder Woman,you are in danger.
So now female superheroines..great👏👏👏👏..who wud accept this fact of a woman being a superheroine....we want them as our sister,wife,mother,
1:30 wtf why did she punch the old women
Amazing awesome fabulous fantastic.......the female superhero.... Best...of...all
I see the views of the DC fans worried about the next wonder woman movie lol
1:29 That old woman is a Skrull?
You wanna here a joke?  a female pilot.....
Excuse me, but I hope that this movie will be an absolute bullshit and it wont eanr money. The reason is quite simple. I hate the way they presenting this hero to the viewers. "She is strong woman with balls, she had difficult past, but now she became strong and she can beat everybody". I am right, that all this scenes with training in army and flashbacks from her past are being copied from Captain America? 
looks like a marvel version of the wonderwoman movie :D
Can we have a good female role in a superhero film? We'll see
Why couldn't Black Widow have had the honor of the first female lead movie? She's been there 10 years! Scarlett Johansson is a reasonable person, she deserves it 10,000 times more than this character just thrown in to start the third waving of the MCU. Scar Jo worked her tail off to make Black Widow a player in a team of supers. She deserved it.
Female superhero with superhero face = "Girl, why don't you smile more?"
WTF she punchs an old woman lmao
Wow, there really ARE a lot of guys out there who are just plain intimidated by women. And I say this as a guy who HATED The Last Jedi and recognize that it was utterly destroyed by feminism.
And to be honest, the women of Marvel deserve a bit more screen time. The most any Marvel woman has had in one movie was Gamora in Guardians of the Galaxy. She only had 31 minutes.
Did she just punch an old woman in the sub way?
When the most excting part of a trailer is an old women getting punched.
I'm pretty sure that the people complaining about this movie is because there's is a women in it as the principal character just like it happened in battlefield 5
Mary Poppins > Wonder woman > Captain marvel
*Marvel's girlfriend is an feminist.!*
Feminists Revolution sucks!!!!!
Here we go with all the Wonder Woman comparisons, and negativity. Personally I am super stoked to see her kick Thanos's ass. Like if you agree!
looks like a straight garbage feminist film
Disappointed with the first trailer. Hope the film is good. The idea of Making a common women a super women that way isnt looking cool.
TOO feminist
I lowkey feel it might be bad, not because its a female, cause j love wonder woman, but it just has an off putting tone. I dont feel soo good about this film, but i would like to see a good film for her, since she is stupid powerful in the comics
This women better save Spider-Man from thanos car
Just hope its better then Wonder Woman...
im sry but there is no hero's style in this woman. im not impressed. will This woman save the universe ? LOL
According to half of the replies here, the old woman is a "scroll".(this is a joke,  by the way, I perfectly know what a Skrull is) 👽
The trailer isn't great but the movie looks very promising. Hopefully for the next few months Brie can keep her mouth shut and her feminist politics to herself
Sounds like a lotta hate from the female hating crowd. Movie looks good and they hit some points from Cpt. Marvel's history in there. Shame we prolly won't see the one piece swimsuit version. Still I read the comments and bulls saying, it's meh or okay and the casting was wrong. I don't see any of that. Sorry, not sorry.
Is this the power of independent woman that doesn't need man
Wonder Woman of Marvel!
em... one I thought it will be boring? girls well no offense, but you don't need superpowers)) you are so own them. Look at the mega super strong woman ..well boring that is ..
Please atleast decide if you wanna be a Wonder Woman or Supergirl knockoff
am disappointed in marvel, who tha f**k is this, is either the casting is wrong or women cant lead marvel against thanos
This looks like a female green lantern but better. Let’s see if it can surpass the black panther hype.
*punches an elderly woman to epic trailer music*
Not like that has happened before... *cough.. Wonder Woman!..cough cough*
This is so cool....she is more strong than superman....and she is woman....i really like this
Brie Larson looks like she's perpetually bored through the trailer. Hope her acting is just cut off in the jump cuts. I need a decent single hero movie. Also Captain Marvel just isn't that interesting, she is just Green Lantern in combo with Superman but a woman. I hope this Movie makes her interesting.
Way too many flash backs in this movie, she's like the female Highlander
So... Marvels Wonder Woman basically??
Im not a sexist...but these are just observable facts whether we like it or not..Superheroes need natural leadership charisma and "power" and commands respect and awe...and we must believe that they really can whoop anything...in our real world when faced with physical dominating danger...who do we turn to? we turn to men naturally and give them the responsibility to protect... Female heroes just can't pull off their own movie unless they are stunning gorgeous (WW)...even most  men who were raving about WW kept talking about how stunning she looks... and I think the best parts in her movie were with Chris Pine..women play great support roles complementary with men(but still with the feminine factor)... the femine factor is being distorted from it's nurchuring , virtuous and compassionate energy.. Hollywood can stop shoving this whole badass kicking woman characters...they've tried that a dozen times and it hasn't worked...with even all female casts and the box office speaks for itself....think about it..and it's not just heroes..which one was the last  iconic female villian we've seen?? Once again every other movie these days have a woman as the "badguy'"now..
Wonder-woman is brunette.captain marvel is blonde.the lighter the skin the less judje-mental that caucasian chick is.she not even judje-mental if she gives you a total disreaspect.
Woooooo 1:30 proves how powerful and cunning the Skrulls are!!!! Two eyed Fury!!!!!! Skrulls!!!!!!! Just imagine this is all happening before Avengers!!!! And this is the woman who's going to fight Thanos!
cap. marvel is a man. not a weak woman.  what a bunch of bullshit
I just hope they dont go the OP Superman route with her character. She needs to be more than just a character just because shes a woman. Make her relatable and someone we love.
and wonder woman my favorite women hero
Not even remotely close to Wonder Woman. What a waste  -_-
I'm scared for this movie I mean, I loved Wonder Woman and I know Captain Marvel is a badass but for me I'm still not over Wonder Woman. I mean if I watch this trailer again I know I will die and go to heaven and I'm not comparing but I loved the way Wonder Woman was made and if they manage to make Captain Marvel unique just like Wonder Woman (which I hope they do) I kinda have mixed feelings about it.
Looks good. Not as overwhelming as avengers or as i thought it would but looks good. Big up to the first female lead ever its been long overdue. Sorry black widow
Female captain america ???
outstanding woman power Namaste🙏🙏🙏
Wonder woman se churaya hai chor.....
This seems so boring lol. That's what happens when you are too triggered to make woman real people and just make them SUPER BADASS TOUGH ULTRA INDEPENDENT DONT NEED NO ONE ELSE boring clones of each other.
Most epic moment? Captin marvel punches a old women in face...
That's how you empower women!!!
It looks like female version of Man of steel😔😔
Punching an old woman in the face?? That's a paddlin' ...
Marvel’s Superman (woman)
She kind of like superwoman for marvel.
Dumb female actor...cant act for shit...looks like she ate a shit salad before acting ... the emotionless face.
Wonder Woman > Captain Marvel. The Trailer as well the Casting is very Disappointing.. especially after standards set by Thor Ragnarok, Infinity War etc by Marvel. This won't work!
Marvel you should not introduced Cap marvel character with over power like Super Man...you should be introduced her with Decent amount of Quality power...I heard that in MCU cap Marvel is the Strongest Super hero....Over power Doesn't suit female characters only male Character's it's perfectly fitted...In DC universe Super Man is over powered like cap Marvel...That's why Audience doesn't want to see other Decent Superheroes like Batman Flash Etc...Bcoz people's always wants to see the best....that's why other DC movies are not much success as Super Man movies...if in MCU if Cap Marvel is introduced as overpowered SuperHero powerful then HULK THOR then in future People's will not want to see other Decent Superheroes Bcoz of cap Marvel like Super Man in DC...That's why you should be introduced her with Decent amount of Quality power not over powered....(personal Thought)
She is not a very powerful women :/ sounds to mousey
I vote Wonder Woman for sure.
So Marvel has gone PC liberal and turned all comic book heroes into blacks and women. I guess if reality can’t make them equal, let’s go to CGI.
Feminists *angrily : Ohhhh!!! Let me guess, cause the main character is a girl
Woman champion!? What a bad movie before it even starts!
Captain Marvel’s a dude in the comics tho... not that it’s a huge deal. But I would rather have marvel make some storylines about actual female characters in the marvel universe rather than gender bend the stories. This should be titled Ms. Marvel... I would love to see a movie about black cat, or just the wasp, or black widow. Keep the characters genders consistent and actually make some movies about original female characters
Woman in first role of a Holywood movie=fail
I don't know why but I am disappointed with this trailer. It's like they are trying to make a movie to compete with Wonder Woman movie but failed horribly. According to this trailer I think this only, let's wait for upcoming trailers/movie that might change my thinking about Captain Marvel movie.
so they had to make the female version , because of feminestum.
And Another female lead character.
Brie Larson wrong pick  special effects quality of tv show I think wonder women did so well they went low on budget this will be good on demand movie if that or if your bored on a Friday with money to waste go for it :)
*smiling old woman gets punched"
THIS MOVIE COMES OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY 🎂 YASSS 💗💗💗 And it comes out in March and that’s the month to celebrate women.
captain marvel is a woman
this is going up against WW for best female led superhero movie, hope it wins or at least ties
Pushing female power agenda at it's finest.
Captain Marvel is the most bad @$$ female superhero ever. Cant wait to see it.
Brie Larson is an amazing actress. But its hard for fans to digest the fact that "a woman avenger" can be more powerful that mighty Hulk or Gigantic Mega powerful THOR who is a God. Hence, comparisons are being made and trailer is receiving negative feedback. 
Ugh.. the captain is a woman, this will be great.
You just keep pushing that feminist superhero agenda Marvel.
Most people will watch the movie to find why did she hit the old women 🤔🤔
Another boring white women trying to save the world. Count me out
there are around 20K people who hate films with a female protagonist... also they probably virgins as well XD
**Captain Marvel vs Wonder Woman**
Just calling it: If you say shit like "Marvel's pushing their feminist agenda, now their movies are gonna suuck", you are sexist.
It's going to be hard to follow up after infinity war was so good and so anticipated. I honestly won't be watching this one simply because her character has never interested me, the actress doesn't appeal to me either. Just so many other movies I'd rather watch and dedicate time to. I'm sure this is a movie I can skip and still be able to follow along with the mcu. I really only watch marvel movies with the hero's and characters I love and I don't like captain marvel no matter her role in the mcu. Sorry marvel not for me. Also as a strong female myself I don't really care for these strong female character movies I watch movies for the hot boys in all honesty so I know this will appeal to those feminists but not me. Oh  well ill wait till the infity war 2 trailer comes out I'll wait to throw my money then.
I just noticed something..the women in the train and the agent guy both are skrulls right..they both have a green shade in their eyes..so thats a way to notice them..atleast for us i think.😅
Feminist gonna cry "DUUUH HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE 43k DISLIKES ?!"
isn't Captain Marvel a guy nothing against women but even the comic books is a guy
can I get an f in the chat for that poor old woman
Sexist marvel just wants a piece of the success Wonder Woman had. If they actually cared to have a leading female role, it wouldn’t have took them 20 movies into the franchise to do so.
“Captain marvel” more like hitting old women’s.
Did anyone notice that this movie premiers on the international women’s day? Coincidence? I think NOT.
Why she punched that *old woman* in the *face?* ( ◔ ʖ̯ ◔ )
A woman lead??? Please....
Lel female lead this movie is gana be cute  I guess
another crap movie that will be hit cx main character is a woman
Women complain when a man is the allpowerfull hero so i think now its time we men go to war. Brothers at arms lets bring down hollywood's tyrany once and forever
A Superwoman like DC? why not!!!! Because we Marvel Can earn Billions 😂
Wonder Woman: Marvel Version ✔️
Let’s mix the thought, you play this trailer while wonder woman theme song is being played
Captain Marvel should be a man not a woman
No one can beat thanos especially not a women
I mean this woman is a important character to the thanos plot..
Captain Marvel is a woman no offense ladys
Feminists: "This is how women would have been if white men had never intervened"
You guys are joking... SHE CAN'T DEFEAT THANOS... she's too cute... same as Wonder Woman..
Don't really care about Cpt Marvel all that much....I just want this  to lead to  Rogue solo Movie done right one day if people know the origin story of Rogue/Xmen  you know Cpt Marvel was the stepping stone to fleshing out I think one of the coolest women in Marvel .....been waiting for that for a looooong time...  :)
I see a lot of dislikes like I saw with DC Wonder Woman from who played her and how the movie will turn out...... But this like Wonder Woman me liking it or not will get love from many
hahaha!.. Little girls are not tough and their not men. But they are very good in the kitchen and as cheerleaders. Like every woman in power... no credibility.
I know everyone loves when there is a super hero moving staring a girl or woman as the superhero
great. another female hero. : (
Captain Marvel just punched an old woman on a train, imagine what she'll do to Thanos..lol
Lmao she just hit an old women in the face!
Whats up with her slapping the old woman?!
will it top wonder woman?  can she save the universe? or will she come back to kill thanos? 
Thanos has never punch an old woman's face in front of mortals...
*Sees an old woman get punched in the face* "Wait what...?" *Watches it again confused* What...? *Watches again for entertainment...Laughs...Feels bad for laughing*.
Captain marvel or wonder woman?
Well guys, feminists have officially taken marvel studios over.
Brie Larson To Play Feminist Icon In New Movie
It's funny cause Wonder women and superman and bat man have the same facial expression every one on here is complaining about.
frankly, dislike that and i prefer the Wonder Woman
She has no personality netflix quality this movie looks horrible but at least it's going to remind every1 how good wonder woman is
Feminist bullcrap
Copying Wonder Womans style of music lol oh Marvel always copying DC but then again DC copies Marvel too so there goes that 🤷‍♂️
Wonder women se pahle koi nahi
she’s never gonna be Wonder Woman.
Anyone also thinks that it will be a women version of Man of Steel?
I'm a simple woman; I see Coulson,  I click like
I love that EVERYBODY...is talking about C.M. punching an old women...😐🤣
Sta woman después va a estar en infinity war
all the feminist "hero" can do -> punch elderly lady. yet another strong "female leading character".
gotta love the female empowerment in this trailer hahaha, will keep the feminazis happy! does look like its gonna be EPIC too!
The future is female indeed...
A female hitting a female?! This is so wrong, women should only hit men! That it’s the meaning of equality.
Women make for horrible action heroes. Never believable.
She came to Earth to scissor Wonder Woman
I thought this woman won an Oscar, why is she so flat and emotionless?
1:09 Oh! I didn't realize she was a female version of Tarzan
Wow, so we have a superman in Marvel its just that this ones female.
Already 50x better than Wonder Woman. 👌🏻
For those who are dissing the movie i know you are DC Fans but still There hasnt been a Marvel movie with a lead Female Role since Elektra You have Wonder Woman so its only fair for Marvel to get Captain Marvel
This is the only superhero trailer that actually moved and intrigued me. I have had zero desire to see any of the superhero movies, not even Wonderwoman,so it’s not because I’m a feminist, I’m just really picky. I really want to see this.
I don’t know how I feel about this movie after she punched that obvious skrull disguised as an old woman, I don’t think I want my future kids to be punching oldies because of this movie
Had they said The Phoenix, Scarlet Witch or many other female characters. Yeah people would stand by this and say Absolutely. The Phoenix could take on the Gauntlet relatively.
The only time my mouth went open was when she punched that old woman
is Gibbs trying to recruit a female triple x
Put feminist joke here ...
So excited for this movie! I think it would be interesting to see how things were in the MCU back then when the world wasn't so aware of the threats, and how they'll literally work an invasion know one even realizes is happening...I guess you would call it a Secret Invasion. Huh. Anyway, looks fantastic, excited with the fact this is the first Marvel female led superhero movie, and honestly excited to see how well they'll pull off this kind of 'youthenizing' CGI for a long duration, not to mention the first appearance of the Skrulls. Will be first in line.
Wonder Woman looked better from the trailers alone. And WW lived up to the hype.
I feel like this was more showing what Phase 4 will introduce with the Skrulls, and likely the idea that they might take the form of the old heroes we love, or at least, that’s my overanalytical justification of why Brie Larson punches an old lady. It looks like it’ll be a mix of Man of Steel and Wonder Woman, in terms of story and quality, where the parts where she’s being human will leave something to be desired, but with some Samuel L. Jackson flair, it looks like it could still be pretty fun. Larson fits the image of Captain Marvel better than I was expecting, so I’m really excited to see her character more than anything else. Marvel’s casting is one of their best qualities, and this is no exception.
It's a woman now. Captain Marvel Christmas Adventures coming soon
*Punches old woman*
Bla bla bla bla...another crappy effort to push a female hero....which won't sell....like the others....
Slaps an old women lol
CAPTAIN MARVEL IS A SKRULL SLEEPER AGENT but she doesn't know it because she had her mind wiped and the memories of a random woman implanted into her to make her think she's human.
It's finally here. God I have been waiting for it. Jackson's back in action. Agent Coulson too hope the story is good cause it's the first of it's franchise. And female mc gogogogo
I think Stan lee will shout at her when she hits the old women 😂👍
Marvel got her wonder woman
Let’s watch Wonder Woman instead
So I'm biased when I say this film looks dull. Not that my humble opinion matters when this film will be pushed like the second coming of Christ and we'll get the obligatory black panther-esque women's power salute, while celebs jump on the bandwagon and call Brie Larson the most empowering woman in history.
Bru i see more lames talkong about feminists than actual feminists
That looks pretty cool. Ms Marvel is coming by in cinemas in March 2018. This will probably in the month of “Women’s International Month” and wow, Brie Larson nailed her established character who can enter to face the situation in previously “Infinity War” and now she face the consequences to bring back the heroes and face Thanos.
After such amazing trailers as Black Panther, Wonder Woman, Ant Man and the Wasp, Godzilla, and even the Bumblebee Movie this was just a bland step back.
This film is feminist propaganda masquerading as good entertainment just like Kathleen Kennedy's Star Wars.
Another Woman glorifying  super hero movie for feminists.....(facepalms)
Disney: OK, so she's gonna be our first female lead superhero. What should  we show in the first trailer?
She found a kree in the train who look like an old woman.
Wonder Woman looks so different in this one.
I remember her on twitter sobbing about a dude who asked her phone number. How hard is the life of a VIP woman in the most rich country of the galaxy, oh if you only knew. We're not supposed to support these kind of shitty persons.
Love it, my beautiful much needed woman super hero kicking some ass. Brie you’re amazing!!!
I don't want to compare DC and Marvel, but I really wanna see how this movie resulting is in critics and income against Wonder Woman.
Superman + WonderWomen = Super Marvel
Oh shit super woman hit an old lady I’m calling the police
She's MY Wonder Woman, Not Dat Gal Gadot Piece of Shit🔥🔥
Man Marvel so many great female actresses and you picked her no range way to drop the ball sad day
a female hero that bleeds every mouth. i'm not sold on the stupid ideal, captain maxi-pad.
Why did she punch that old woman
0:15 this woman can’t get up from a fall when she is the most powerful woman ever
They literally got the worst actor for the role! I'm not against that the main character is a woman, but atleast bring someone who can act.
DC: We have Wonder Woman
Feminists doing his best.
"She looks bored and doesn't show enough emotion..." = Every douchebag ever who has told girls/women they should, "smile more".
It will beat Wonder Woman😎😎
the truth is: I stop watching feminist movies and PS4 feminist games
Captain Marvel is for me a MAN! So sad that the studios pushing women quota... lame! Fantasy is ok.. BUT nature tells another story! Woman are not as hard as man! never ever... seeing a woman punching and kicking around man is so ridiculous! And i know what i am talking about.. cause i am a martial arts fighter for over 2 decades... female emancipation is also a big plan to divide man and woman... it is also ridiculous! Also the movie title is quite miss leading... i should be: Mrs. Marvel HAHA!! but toxic TransGender is everywhere! fry in hell idiots... Nature will punish you anyway!
كسم marvel علي كسم captain marvel علي كسم ال feminist يا ولاد المرة الشرموطة يا شوية تياظ بضان
Also female captain marvel is my favorite female hero, i hope it's going to be epic. This trailer didn't make go full hyped mode, but when i saw that last part of the trailer i got hopes that this movie will be great, but will see. I'll wait for the second trailer.
I think all heroes need to be women. Men are trash. Plus women are better at representing heroes.
Not ten seconds in, and there's already product placement. Anyway, this is basically Supergirl + Wonder Woman + Green Lantern. We'll see.
Can’t wait for this movie to be praised because it has a female main character.
All the feminists are dripping wet watching this
Well the feminists are gona go ape for this... fml
Dam this is like the feminist movie 2018... Feels like I'm watching the life story of some random ass chick instead of a superhero movie... I'm gonna be disappointed aren't I
Bro the amount of comments saying this movie “looks trash” is ridiculous. Honestly I can’t help but think this seriously is all because it’s bri Larson and she’s a female lead hero. I’m not saying anyone is “sexist” but from the moment this movie was announced and she was cast I saw thousands of fans IMMEDIATELY bash the movie. We get it you guys are used to seeing guys be the lead and kick ass. It won’t kill you to see one female lead hero! Geez. Be open minded.
Feminist bullshit
Ehhh, looks awful. Had to p.c. it up and make Captain Mar-vel a chic. The power does go to a woman, but not in this timeline. Sooo, i can wait another year or maybe 5
So...when she punched that old lady...it reminded me of that video where the black lady slapped the old white woman for spitting on her 😂
Is it me or is pretty much every female superhero just really boring?
*whispers* Black Widow should have been the ‘first’ female marvel superhero movie but oh well 🤷🏻‍♀️ FML
green lantern vibe?? man of steel vibe??? wonder woman vibe????
I think this film actually is going to be better then "Wonder woman". I would count this as the first female superhero film.
female superhero movies... its just too beyond belief even for a movie.
The trailer was epic until she punched the old woman in the face.
Ppl saying she has no facial expressions are probably just not used to looking for expressions on a woman's face unless it's big and obvious. This will be good training for you! :)
So thanos is gonna get his ass kicked by a woman 😂
Is it wrong I laughed when she right hooked an old woman. I mean that woman wouldve 720 through the bus window because Captain marvel is super strong right?
LMAO could never be compared to Wonder Woman, this just doesn't transmit anything
Wonder Woman is still better
punches old woman in the face
The MCU is another film franchise hijacked by feminists.
Wonder Woman still better
Do we really need ANOTHER female superhero movie? 😒
YEAH! I’m so excited! I never thought I’d see the day I’d get to see a female bad ass super hero that wasn’t just Wonder Women!
That's how you make a female superhero movie DC and that's the type of actress you choose for the role!
I will not watch woman super hero bullshit
Below Average Trailer she looks dead inside and feels like I watched a Green lantern and wonder woman mixed trailer
I bet you all the box office money it'll be wonder woman, cause as always marvel makes THE best trailers to THE best movies
So to clarify....The women needs special space powers to be the (Her)o?  Very subtle and if you go the TLJ route then good luck.  Also He says I never thought one would come from above? So Thor?  Hell even EGO had been to earth before hand.  Anything to make her fit and save the Avengers.
Wonder woman > captain marvel
Yeah...I'm sure this will be as good as wonder woman lol (extreme sarcasm implied)
that poor old woman > thanos
Uh, nope.  She couldn't deliver her lines with a dump truck.  Also, I am 100% certain, that this will be a gigantic, feminist, circle jerk.
thats the way to endeer yourself to your audeince slapping the elderly. Wonder Woman should take note at Captain Marvels Charm....This looks like crap.
I am really hyped to finally see why she hit the old woman.
I hope this one is as good as wonder woman
She can take Thanos. She punched an old woman.
This is gonna be better than wonder woman
Way to go Marvel, got yourselves a stepford wife. Yawn! They're really pushing this feminist agenda hard.
All super hero'd out. How many more super heros do we really need? plus the feminist bs. nothing worth watching anymore, same old shit, different day. No imagination in this generation, same boring song and dance......
These are the good times. We are going to have an ultimate badass female superhero who wears a fully covered suit, the first female doctor, and so many other all-female lead stories like oceans 8, etc. Hollywood is getting better.
Yes yes first strongest super female hero miss marvel first movie I love it...
Nope Nope....more feminist agenda in hollywood.
Big fan of Brie. I’m hoping she brings the strong female presence CM has and doesn’t need loads of well delivered one liners to pander to target audiences. She’s Captain Marvel ffs lol. 
Wonder Woman could easily kick her Ass 😂😂😂
If this movie feminist Agenda with man hating garbage. Men vote with your wallet don't see this garbage. If this movie is like Wonder women then go see it and enjoy the movie.(MGTOW)
Already better than Wonder Woman lol
Punching an old woman. It's metaphor. Death will be won in victory. 
Now im more convinced than ever hollywood should simply get captain marvel, wonder woman and rey from star wars to defeat all evil in the cosmos. No men required thankyou.
Seriously? We bring in a black hero, then a female hero? Smh, society today is bonkers. Stick to white and male protagonists.
Watch as nobody will care about the "female hero" thing since this character has always been a woman. 
Incoming - the female hating crowd of commenters
That her punch a old woman.I think the old woman is skrull
O man it’s a woman
ready for competing with wonder woman....
I had to rewind the video as soon as I saw that old woman get punched lol
I thought wonder woman was terrible and I think this will be terrible. I'll watch it on DVD but I'll be on my phone as it plays. I always need background tv..
when they said the future is female this is what they meant. also, thanos said no MAN can beat him idk sis what about lesbian icon Carol Danvers
Wonder Woman has left the chat
Nope. Get back in the kitchen woman and fix thanos a sandwich.😂
Finally a strong female hero???🤔🤔🤔
And if female superhero is what you're looking for then WW84 is coming soon.
1:28 im sorry is there a lack of powerful females in the MCU or something? The Seneca Falls convention is over people, i think its time to grow up.
She doesn't have the charisma that wonder woman has.
She’s no Wonder Woman, but she’ll be a close second!
Think it would be a better cameo if the old woman skrull was Stanlee.
Watching this trailer who else is comparing this video with Wonder Woman? I sure Captain Marvel is also gonna bring the same amount of excitement to those who didn't even know anything about her unlike Wonder Woman.
Hey strong female character and guess what?! No heels! Let's go Cap!!!
Their are many better female actress for this role
Very big Marvel fan. But this is nowhere near Wonder Woman and she doesn't have the charisma of Gal Gadot.
DC's Wonder Woman and Marvel's Captin Marvel I'M  HERE FOR IT!!!
Old women : he's my friend
I thought captain marvel is gonna be a big muscular hero to face Thanos. There is no fun in watching Thanos getting beaten by a woman.
This is cause ITS TRUE. The Comics are already written. Scarlet Witch who in case you forgot is a Woman. Is way way way stronger than Captain Marvel. 
I said it before I'll say it again she doesn't look right for the part, she shouldn't be such a standard body type she should be taller and more masculine. More aggressive cool this is just woman drama
Captain marvel is a Woman😂
If you don't count the Catwoman or Elektra movies, this being the second female superhero led movie is different from Wonder Woman chiefly because of the title. The title alone breathes feminism at its best. To the uninitiated many will likely think they're seeing a movie about a man, and why not. Captain America is a dude so clearly Captain Marvel is too. 
With this Women's Revolution thing going on, this movie should do well. It may pull women into the theaters like Wonder Woman did, but not as many. Plus, it has S.L.J. in it so it can be all that bad.
So when did Captain Marvel trans into Caitlyn Jenner. I don't remember him from the comic's being a woman. Todays times are so screwed up. Next thing ya know, they'll remove the word "man" from all the other charters because its offensive. SpiderZen, IronIt........
the fact that the did that stupid her into a hero text transition is so obnoxious we get it it’s a female superhero.
I hate woman superhero😏😏😏
So, is her super power being a woman or?...
Nah... I rather watch wonder woman 2
wonder woman is muuuuuuuch hotter
It looks like she just is super strong and stands back up again when she gets knocked down, Captain America already does this. And Iron man already flies and shoots "lasers" from his hands. So why her when there are more interesting female superheros that would be much more interesting. We could watch Rescue (Potts in an Iron man suit without weapons) Work with Maria Hill to save the country from itself post snap. Or we could FINALLY get a black widow movie like she deserves. Or have a story about black cat that could tie in with homecoming  or have Dazzler to make the story more musical based like guardians was. I want a woman led movie but I want a good woman led movie.
Wonderful woman is Better than Cap M this is the worst  trailer in mcu
*God is a woman*
Hmm didn't get as pumped as when I saw the wonder woman trailer.
That great the first female hero with a solo movie by marvel! Can’t wait
Wonder woman aint got shit on her
Watch this then compare it to the wonder woman trailer
So its a Cosmic, Female, 90s Winter Soldier movie?
1:27 What we need right now is a "woman" erm I mean "a hero"...
Who's the Strongest Super Heroine : Wonder Woman or this girl ?
Rip wonder woman
1:27 thanks Marvel, never knew she was a female superhero.
Terible actress for this role. All I see is feminist slathered all over this film.
She about to make wonder woman look weak af!
Wonder women sucks captain marvel rocks🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Did the woman the clocked by captain marvel?
I mean I like scarlet and widow but when the feminists come up with a character or drive a story they make them overpowered and it sucks bigtime. and it not just women characters trust me I absolutely hate superman, he is the worst right behind wonder woman.
Fun fact: The black female  pilot walking next to Carol around the minute mark is Maria Rambeau, mother of Monica Rambeau. Yes Marvel fans, go apeshit. Everyone else, carry on...
She punched the old lady for mansplaining what a Mary Sue is, and then manspreading on the bus, which are both violations of the superspacefeminist code book.
RIP Wonder Women
Don't get me wrong, wonder woman is a great movie... But Carol is way different than her... BETTER BE DIFFERENT!
So it’s just a copy of Wonder Woman ...
Are we going to see the Captain  Marvel as an old woman(like Peggy Carter) in Avengers 4? Just asking!
everybody jss saying this cause they salty shes a woman smh... cant wait to watch it!!! 😭👏🏼
As long as she’s not a feminist, this movie will be good
@feminists happy scream@
You can tell they're going to play the "I am woman, hear me roar" angle by the "little girl, older girl, young woman, kick ass full grown woman superhero" montage at 1:41. Which might not be bad.... but you know how lazy studios get with this shit, they think that's enough to carry the whole movie.
Punching an old women is not a heroic thing!
Any man here ever gotten their ass kicked by a woman?
*_1:31_**_ she slapped an old woman!!!😓_*
Looks boring, she's a racist, and the the whole feminist agenda stench is all over it.   First marvel one I won't bother seeing.
I don't like her as the actor for this movie. That name should be Shazam's instead. Captain marvel on a women just don't sound right
Not very interested. I’m not a sexist pig I would actually like to see spider woman (Jessica drew) movie
Not good as wonder woman.
Another feminist clit fest.
When this flops (and it will), who the feminists gonna blame this time?
Did she just punch an old woman in the face? Sold!
Marvel's response to Wonder woman
god is a woman and i'm religious
for those who think that this is going to be a bad movie - guys you are totally opposite to feminist. If a woman is getting so good power then you oppose her, but if a man like thor gets good powers, then you are like an ultimate fan.
Who would watch this ?  Its ridiculous. Captain Marvel is a man. With all of these women in positions of physical power .... whatever enemy of the west that promotes this stuff .... " We just  might as well put a gun up to all of our temples and pull the trigger."
trailer was average, mainly because of a female role don't think its gonna be that great, this is most likely gonna be the dent in marvels movies, I had sooo much respect for them before this comes out, hopefully they can change it for the better, its just not that great and honestly think its a bomb
First woman marvel movie 
C is a pilot n c wears a green n black costume. Her name is Kara oops Carol Danvers. C looks like female version of green lantern
And I had intuition that captain marvel will spoil current MCU....now confirmed. At the very least, I hope its not feministic cooked up nonsense like wonderwoman
Soo boring and brie larson feels like "why am i even here...." No charisma like wonderwoman
We now have a veeeeery pissed god, two cosmic powered women, and they all have this glowy eye thing going on now.
2. For your first female led movie, how dare you let a man narrate most of your leading trailer?
Why did she punch that old women?
I think Captain Marvel will be the strongest female AVENGERS.😊😊😊
This looks so a generic movie,i hope that i am wrong, but so far.... i will not put my money to see this, and no because is a woman.
Why is captai marvel a woman
You mfs love women and hate them so much at the same time. Must be really conflicting😂😂
women can can defeat thanos
DC got Gal Gadot and Marvel gets chubby average looking blonde woman. Can't wait to not look at her 1 hour and 30 minutes.
with almost every people explaing her origin being a kree with emotionless character people are calling her out for her acting skills. his woman won an oscar let that sink. with a casting choice directly from comic fan and president of mcu, they know what theyre going.
the feminist life
is anyone else paying $10 for a movie ticket just to see one of the most powerful marvel superheroes literally knock out an elderly woman? cos you can bet your ass i am.
Just hope the movie doesn’t have a feminist agenda
Old Women: "NANI?!"
Old Woman: Donald Trump isn’t actually *that* bad!
My favourite part was when she slapped the old woman
I'm kinda tired of these representations of heroic womans that don't fight to get power and improve, but accept their condition as a divine gift. (Just the opposite to Dr.Strange, Spiderman, Thor, and all the other masculine heroes but Vision). (I haven't seen the Wasp yet)
How about we just do the movie about a girl super hero without all the overwhelming feminist overtones??????
The trailer looks way better than the Wonder Woman movie
1:28 She deadass just punched an old woman 😂
Can't really say much just from that first trailer but judging for what I saw, She's a good actress but man she has the same expression on most of the shots and her voice seems too... I don't know cute maybe I don't sense a Jessica Jones/Ronda Rousey like toughness added to the character but anywho is just the first trailer so we'll see. Regardless I love the fact that is a female leading role and also love the MCU but not sure about this one. I hope I'm wrong though.
She had a life hire! She punched  old womens or  skrulls?
I think marvel is waiting on wonder woman’s release date to throw this into the mix and see if captain marvel can shake up the box office against Wonder Woman great move marvel. 😆
thats right people our last hope is a white woman lol
Guys let’s just remember, before we judge Carol hitting an old woman, Tony Stark beat up an 100+ year old man who just wanted his best friend back
This is much better than all the cringy fan-made trailers that kept emphasizing that she's a woman.
Can you hear Sony and all the libtards shouting that manbabies don't like superhero movies that have a woman as a main character? No, you don't. Because they don't exist. Can't wait to see it!!
Captain marvel bringing wrath of the feminists on you.
This doesn’t even look worth my time on kodi. She even looks bored playing cpt marvel and the feminist card really?
This feminist vegan trans is going to one shot Thanos and save the day? Sigh..
No female lead movie can top 'Wonder Woman'. It was one of a kind, like "The Dark Knight"
A feminist SuperMan Movie , plus the plot is nothing special :\
Soundtrack, Cinematography, young Coulson & Fury, the Blockbuster/old Woman joke, THAT MOTHERFUCKNG MOHAWK! and ofc the binary mode = pure perfection & loving the "her" to "hero" transformation <3
the trailer looks like it was made by DC, anyone else getting the same vibes? Almost like if DC were to recreate Green Lantern with a feminist twist and a sprinkle of Marvel on top.
this looks awesome..can't wait..this and wonder woman
Yet another flop. How can these studios invest such huge amounts on female action leads given their target audience is primarily young males? It borders on incompetence. The studio deserves to lose money on this trash.
Not sure I can say much about this other than same old, same old (apart from punching an old woman - that's new and about the only interesting thing in the trailer). Not blown away by this and not bothered one way or another about seeing it but then again I've been like that about all the Marvel films apart from Infinity war and Deadpool.
Rip that old woman
I would like to propose to the internet that we stop getting so worked up about the fact that Captain Marvel is female and wonder if the movie is going to be any good.
Feminists are raging if this movie don’t do well
This finna beat wonder women at the box office
Häää captin Marvel is a women ?? Lol i think is men
2. They will force her to become strong female icon. Which wouldn't work because Icon born naturally not forced. Hermione for me is an icon for a franchise born naturally.
another female empowerment movie.
A female lead with NO feminist propaganda?? Marvel is kicking ass!
Makes Wonder Woman look like an after school special
1:30 whoever is upset about the woman getting punched, she's actually a skrull, skrulls are shapeshifters, and they're the main villains in this movie.
Something tells me if this film wasn’t starring a woman, there wouldn’t be nearly as many cynics here.
Captain Marvel vs Wonder Woman: Dawn of women's league
Cause I don't want this movie to be critisized as being "feministic" when it doesn't actually have anything to do with feminism.
Just another female bashing male agenda! Same bull another title !
i cant wait for a movie of a woman who can defeat Thanos lol
Don’t get me wrong I liked the trailer but I wish movies-superhero movies especially- would stop giving away major plot points or twists or showing clips of what is supposed to be something powerful or amazing in the trailer. I was really hoping that we would not see her going binary at all and it would be saved for the movie. Or even be saved for A4. This is my big problem with these trailers lately. The worst one that comes to mind is BVS showing wonder woman saving Batman from doomsday. Why would you spoil that in a trailer! But DC isn’t the only offender. The Thor Ragnarok trailers gave the entire plot away! Don’t get me wrong the movie is great but I would rather have not known going in that: Thor was going to lose his hammer, get taken to the grandmaster played by Jeff Goldblum, have to fight Hulk, team up with his brother, and go back to Asgard to fight Hela. Oh and I wish I had not known that Surtur was going to show up either. I got all of that from less than six minutes over three trailers. It’s not the only Marvel movie or even superhero movie to do this but that one is the one that sticks out the most to me. Leave some mystery! I mean you’re not adapting straight from the comic books anyway so let there be at least a few surprises in the theater. Rant concluded. 😬
When I watched it I didn't even notice nick fury wasn't wearing his eye patch.Just shows how good my observational skills are lol.The film looks brilliant though,nice to see a female lead M.C.U
Let's make it Wonder Women vs Captain Marvel 💥💞
sorry marvel, i dont like this :( i dont have any 'that's super hero!' feeling like i see black widow or even gamora or even DC's wonder woman.
Marvel just doesn't have a female character that's as well known and as beloved as Wonder Woman.
I wonder if this will tank compared to WW or if marvel decided to turn off their get woke mode. WW did amazing because they didn't feel the need to shove femlnlsm, girl power and that agenda down everyone's throat. They didn't feel the need to remind you the lead is a female and said female is 'strong, smart and independent' every 5 minutes. Especially at the expense of men, which seems to be the trend. Make women look better by making the men look 100x worse. Guess time will tell with this.
Doesn’t look that good tbh. People only care about this shit cause ‘she’s a woman’
Not impressed yet, surprisingly, I don't know, maybe it's because they claim her to be super OP before she evens has a movie, or maybe because they're more focused on having a female lead character than making a movie and releasing a trailer that brings little to no hype...not sure, but im just not feeling it quite yet. ☹
It will probably be ok.  Guardians of the Galaxy was not a popular comic when 1st issued (as far as I know).  Neither was Capt. Marvel.    Who knows how popular it will be.  So help me out how many Marvel Capt. Marvel's existed.  Black Female. Now Blonde Female one or two males and the Kree alien.  Then from Fawcett and later DC there was Capt. Marvel family.    I have only about half a box of Marvel Capt. Marvel and about a small comic box of DC's Capt. Marvel SHAZAM.
This looks kinda boring imo. Then again im not the biggest captain marvel fan. Also the marketing ive seen for this really annoys me with the whole “the future is female” thing. Wonderwoman never marketed its self like that.
Meh......Wonder Woman looked better
Hmm... well..... I wish more roles went to azz-kickers in real life. Let's groom some of the female Mixed Martial Artists, and female boxers etc to be actors. People with natural athletic builds. Brie is a fantastic actress but she looks 95 pounds. It honestly took away from the trailer FOR ME. Don't get me wrong, I'm going to see the movie, but I'd settle for a B grade performance from someone else. Best of luck Brie!
come on Marvel studios, this isn't the first Marvel film where the protagonist is a female😑😑
Yay....another female superhero................ Now all we need is a black female superhero version of it and maybe an asian.............and errebody included, this sorta shit is killing movies!
In theaters on International Women's Day! Well played Marvel!
Lmao sooo many dudes butt hurt that it’s a female led super hero movie 😂
I really love that I'm paying to see Wonder woman again
I didn’t like the actor in the first place so no I am not supporting this worthless feminist driven movie.
yes, check that old womans priviledge by beating her into a coma
I can already smell all the pretentious feminism and female empowerment that this movie is going to splat in our faces. Mark my words, this film is going to be like Wonder Woman minus the likeable main protagonist.
wonder woman rules xD
Looks like a female version of green Lateran
Looks like hot garbage. She also has no shape. Why can't we have curvy, sexy white women in movies anymore?
Female Superhero movie is the new blockbuster.  
Yay another white blonde blank female lead! you go girls!
Let's see everyone pretend they have reasons for hating on this other than the most likely fact that they simply don't want a female-led MCU film.
" *IM NOT WHAT YOU THINK I AM,* I AM THE DESTROYER OF OLD PEOPLE" - Feminist Marvel 2018
Smilegate?  The day women stop "resisting" is the day they will have equal footing.   A man wouldn't give a chit.  We shrug and click on the next nonsense.
When i hear the word "captain" i think of a male, but then i remember that a captain is a leader... i guess since most are males? Idk. I dont have a problem with female doing it, hell shes kinda cute. And marvel movies entertain me, so ill watch it. Bootlegged, but ill watch it
I like how....."feminist oral salad", followed by an "all women are strong" comment and dismount off the idea that "women are better than men" ---stick the delusional landing.
She just clapped that old woman round the face 😂
Boo don't jock wonder woman marvel that's a dc wb thing and your mocking them this is why I don't like Disney marvel
It's clear this movie is riding entirely on hype and catering to feminists.
Is Captain Marvel really a female ??..
The level of appeal Brie Larson brings to this character who I previously knew little about actually makes me want to vomit out every last curdled, bitter, trace of estrogen in my big, hairy, body. Gal Gadot's as perfect as Linda Carter's Wonder Woman made me want to cheer, open doors and manscape.
Marvel version of wonder woman!!😅
Literally bootleg Superwoman....smh
A woman-hero 😶 nahhh...I’m gonna pass it
Kicking Wonder Woman's ass at a theater near you
Eh expected more lmao, they really pushed the fact that she's a women in my opinion, which I have to trouble with at all
Same vibe. Another fish out of water story except Wonder Woman probably did it better.
Brie looks like she has the emotional range of a soggy cardboard box. How does this woman get roles when she only has a single facial expression?
I thought captain marvel was a woman
I still don't know what is the meaning of hitting the old woman
*all I see is DC fanboys saying this sucks and Shazam is better and or Wonder Woman is better in the comment section*
Looks like Marvel's version of Catwoman.
*sees Capt. Marvel punch an old woman*
Wonder Woman is QUAKING
Ahh essa então é a Capitã das Feministas?
And she The the bracelet thingy like Wonder Woman so.
My Favorite Female Superhero
I’m a feminist and I do not approve DISLIKE
She looks more powerful in the *COMICS* , in here she's just looks like a Green Power Ranger who punches old women.
I don't like this actress, but since she is a woman, obviously I will see.. and the movie looks sooo  good 😱😃
In debate between Wonder Woman  and Captain Marvel !!!
Is it just me or does Kara..I mean Carol feel like a ripoff of Supergirl, I mean think about it, she arrives to earth in a similar fashion, by crashing. She wears a blue and red uniform, is strong and fast, has durability, can fly and is resistant to toxics... you get the point. I mean, it wouldn’t be the first time that marvel rips off some of DC’s ideas, say, deathstroke to deadpool, Adam warlock to vision, Catwoman to black cat.. yeah.
Might as well call this Captain Feminist
mrs marvel :punches old woman
If u didnt know the old woman is a Skrull(Shapeshifter)
oh gosh..wonder woman vs captain marvel in 2019
"Women can do whatever men can" propaganda film just like ghostbusters (2016).... 
Damn this Captain America Woman Version is really cool
Her title, symbol and costume as well as the timeline resemble Captain America's; her connection with space and her amazing powers resemble that of Thor; her passion for weapons and shooting resemble Iron man's; her fighting skills and mysteriousness resemble Hawkeye's; her origin story of a person getting powers due to a one time accidental event resembles Hulk's; finally, her role as the only powerful woman amongst many powerful men (Black panther, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, Ant-man and Star Lord, or Guardians of the Galaxy in general for that matter, but neither Nebula nor Gamora or Mantis is the most important Guardian whatsoever) resembles Black widow's. 
Hah, told ya, wonder woman is hotter than this movie :*
Poor old woman :'c
Compared to Wonder Woman, this trailer is trash... But I'm a Brie Larson fan so I'll watch it nonetheless but I can't help imagining Jennifer Lawrence in this role... She would've been an ideal choice....
This movie looks like a mix of Wonder Woman and Green Lantern. Could be great, could flop. Impossible to tell because it's just a teaser trailer.
I'm glad she doesn't seem so OP. This means That Avengers 4 won't be just her taking Thanos to town and her shouting "WOMAN POWEEEERRRRR!" (Not that I disagree w feminism) but no one should single-handedly be able to take down Thanos. Although the gauntlet isn't nearly as powerful as it is in the comics, it's still THE INFINITY GAUNTLET. I'm glad that Marvel realises this. Tony is a key factor in taking down the mad titan because Doctor Strange saved him. This means that Tony and Carol will need each other and the rest of the remaining heroes to win. Also I hope that this movie isn't too over shadowed by Avengers 4 which comes out 2 months later. Wonder Woman was fantastic but let Marvel show you how to make a female superhero movie
Captain marvel taught me to slap old women on the bus for no reason
There trying to copy the success of wonder woman wowww marvel. Your gonna get some backlash
I don't know. Maybe it's that Captain Marvel never was one of my favorite heroes (I prefered Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Wonder Woman, and Black Canary in my younger days to name a few). Maybe I'm just worried about her being too OP upon arrival in Avengers 4. I can't say why, but I'm just not excited for this movie. None of the promos or this has gotten me truly excited. I hope the movie changes my mind, but my hopes aren't high.
Looking like female version of thor 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
a very exaggerated female character 😑
Here come the feminists...
This movie will not be criticize because the hero is a woman ohhh shitt!! U know what i mean 🤣🤣
A female Green Lantern it looks like
Just saying... Wonder Woman is better
Looks dull and boring but no doubt it will be a smash hit according to the critics because it's a female superhero movie.
Can she like, smile, ever? Why so serious? Looks absolutely boring. I would rather see Aquaman, that should tell you something. Hard PASS for the first Marvel movie that is gonna tank so, so hard. There are so many better characters like Black Widow, Jean Grey, Psylocke, etc, that could have made for a kick-ass movie like Wonder Woman.
There are several comments here by people claiming to have read "all the marvel comics" and that there was never a female Capt Marvel... I mean....She first appeared in Marvel Super-Heroes #13 wayyyy back in the day (1960s/70s??) - I only remember some of those older editions by number because my uncle was a collector and he only let us touch certain books; #13 was one of them :)
"I'm not what you think I am" said every female ever.
Are you ready for "Wonder Woman 1984" 💪💪👑👑
I hope the entire movie will make up for her lifeless acting and stale looks. Her acting reminds me of the costar female from
Wonder women better than her
Thank you for bringing the most powerful woman Brie Larson as Carol Danvers as a superheroine that made me cry!
OMGGGGGG!! AMAZING!!I can't believe that we will have the chance to see young Fury and Coulson paired with this freaking badass woman!!!
I like it but it better not be some woman over men bullshit
My question is will the fans and critics rate this better than Wonder Woman?
Man I can't believe they totally dissed the original male character of Captain Marvel and went with a woman instead. SMFH.
Did... Did she just hit an old woman? Okie
Please don’t ruin her by making her a feminist. Srysly I’m all for genders being equal, but feminism just sucks.
Low key did any one else see her punch that old woman’s face in
1:40 Batwoman from DC spotted! :D
Looks like garage for little feminist girls.
Yes everyone this is the woman who gonna kill thanos🤷‍♂️I love it..
Oh wow a back to the past movie like wonder woman
Omg!!! It happened!!!! A real movie about a  female heroine without the feminist BS!!!! MY GOD I JUST!! AHHH@!!
Captain Feminist... when will we have superhero fatigue?????
Feminists cheated with this one. The only reason people are gonna watch this is cause it's a tie-in to the next Infinity War movie other than that this movie as a stand-alone is utter crap
That women’s gonna get me my spidey back 😭👌🏻😍
I dont care about all the feminists who are going to swarm all over this movie, nothing will ruin this movie for me.
A B- trailer showing how bored she looks. I am glad it wasn't anything about "Diversity" or women power but I fear that trailer is next. Also she better not be the one to defeat Thanos...
lol did she slap the shit out of an old woman
Not another feminist agenda movie.
Think back to how badass Gal Gadot was as she spoke for the first time as Wonder Woman, I got chills. 
The reason she punched that old lady (1:30) is because this movie deals with Skrull invasions most likely. Carol Danvers was a human, modified with Skrull DNA. The Skrull are an alien race at war with the Kree, that's why you see Ronin the Accuser from guardians at 1:32 . Most likely that old woman was a Skrull hiding as a human.
R.I.P wonder women
Will Captain marvel better then wonder women?
ITT: YouTube commenters can't read women's facial expressions. What a surprise.
0_0...Wonder women who
Wonder Woman vs Captain Marvel
I dont know why, but this trailer remembers me wonder womans trailer style.
I prefer wonder women
This is gonna be shit like wonder woman. These agendas are getting tiresome
My brain still has aids from the take on GITS, "Woman discovers herself, a journey of courage and bad writing." Please do not make the same mistakes.
Wonder women is still better
A little bit disappointed of the trailer ! I don't know why it is quite weird seeing Captain Marvel punching an old woman (obviously a skrull ) Hope the movie will be better !! 😁😁
Wonder Woman : Good Trailer = Not that good of a movie
I'd still bet on wonder woman.
Female superman.
This movie would look better with a guy as the main superhero instead of a woman
Why in the role of captain marvel old woman ((
Every1 talks bad about dc and now here's marvel copying them,this is nothing but a wonder woman ripoff why couldn't marvel give a female lead a chance before?!?!
I always said shes the number 3 to Wonder Woman's number 1
Here's what Wonder Woman should have been. I'm so hiped.
Wonder Woman time to pack your BAG!!!! lol
Against D. C. Wonder Woman...marvel captain from MARVEL..🤣🤣🤣
Future is woman..
1:30 *Punches old woman with dramatic music*
.... This does NOT mean I hate women.  That's such a stupid logic.
Wonder woman in marvel
Not for women above 90...lol
Wonder woman was far greater than this bulls**t
Women can be superheroes just don't focus on the female aspect of it
When she punched that old women.. that's when I started loving her🤷🏻‍♂️😂😂
I'm excited, but this better be good. I would hate to see the first marvel movie centered around a female to be a flop.
That 4k dislikes is from Wonder Woman fans..
im sorry but wonder woman is better...!!
"How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old woman!"
In the End she looks like wonder woman in climax fight
Wonder Woman trailer is much better
Be careful Wonder Women
And who cares of female wants.
She hit an old woman !?
This movie finna destroy Wonder Woman and Wonder Woman 2 lmao
Just a wanna be Wonder Woman movie. Not even close. This is garbage.
For the people saying "people are just salty because it's a woman" it's a fictional movie, what is there to be salty about, it has nothing to do with real life. And imo the trailer was kinda bland.
*THIS WILL BE MARVEL'S FIRST BOMB! Tired of women getting screen time, just because!!!*
*Captain Feminist*
i m vry exited watching captain marvel....ultimate power nd supavvv....women.....i hope this movie batter then😊
She hitted the old woman in the bus
I think Hollywood is only interested in casting androgynous bodied women in movies now. Where’s the love for curvy women?
This is the first female-led Marvel film... if the movie sucks as much as this trailer does... I am going to be soooooooooooo disappointed :_(
Why am I not surprised that right wingers are blaming the left and feminism for the making of this movie.... 🙄 if your going to be a fan of the MCU please do SOME research captain marvel has been around FOR YEAR. She’s not some made up MCU character for feminists have some respect
watch the feminist complain about this
The old woman was confirmed to NOT be a skrull, she was just in carols seat.
Its a female Superhero and i am not mad at all. looks good. Well done.
Did she Puch a old woman?
Feminists,where y'all at?
Hopefully this movie won’t draw too much attention to the fact that she’s a woman
I’m confused here, Captain Marvel is Shazam.  DC just made a movie “Shazam” how is Marvel making a movie called “Captain Marvel” and making him a woman?  And ok maybe Marvel has its on Captain Marvel in their universe but how is he a woman now? 
This looks really feministy and lame. But it's Marvel, so I'll give it a shot
Don’t trip guys that old woman was obviously a skrull.
Dosnt captain marvel fly . So this is gonna be the 2nd female hero film when they don't fly wonder women being the 1st
If they go with that hole feminist shit, this movie is gonna suck
Captain America Version Female
Just came back from watching the Wonder Woman trailer. It made me want to watch the movie again, despite having watched it 3 times already. Marvel Studios are really messing up with this Captain Marvel movie... :(
Imagine if that old woman wasn't actually a skrull...
A bit mixture of Wonder Woman and Shazam, seems interesting to me.
2 female fighter pilots with aviators on, not even surprised.
As being a 21st century man and millennial, i don't care if people gonna say like female empowerment or equal  leading role and stuff, real question is ' Is the Captain Marvel T H I C C ? '
I love female superheroes. That's why i'll watch Wonder Woman 84.  Not this boring shit.
*Feminists They Scares Me*
Cuando fui a ver Wonder woman no esperaba mucho pero se convirtio en una de mis peliculas favoritas de super heroes, no puedo esperar a ver a la Capitana Marvel!!
Am I the only one who isn’t sold by her face like I don’t see the passion or is the savior of the avengers a cold face woman?
*Insert strong female protagonist*
Wont be as good as wonderwomen.
Female superhero. Looks like shit.
When an old woman creepily offers you candy. 1:39
I predicted Venom's success&200millon weakened, you can see it in the comment box(3rd trailer, sep25-october3, there are many comments😊). Your movie is going to suck, belive me. Choosing female director was the biggest mistake. And choosing Brie was the second mistake. This movie going to be a disgrace. Everyone is going to hate Avenger 4 bcz of her. You should do something before it's too late👍
Cant wait to find out why the old women got punched
I ain't a feminist but
More women empowerment shitting out of hollywood. Let's hope it focuses actually on the comics.
One powerful -boi- woman
OK but watch this video while listening to Man! I Feel Like a Woman by Shania Twain
Captain Marvel is going to be the Wonder Woman of 2019!
What a movie?want a female character save avenger member and defeat thanos? ......Bad story
Bravo Marvel! Captain Marvel is better than Wonder Woman.
Wonderwoman = *Comment*
o look another badass woman....... its like they want men to roll there eyes
*beats an old woman*
Looked underwhelming and forgettable if I'm being honest. Definitely a "Wait till it's on Netflix" kind of movie. Tried to one up wonder woman, failed in doing so.
I don't know about this actress. Couldn't they have pick a woman that was a credible badass instead of this one? Even her voice sounds boring.
the soundtrack  wuuuuhuuuuuuuu kinda goosebump love it...just like wonder woman theme..ww might be even better but this is good too
was gonna watch but found out she is feminist douche so now no more seeing this movie. so far still no netflix, not seen solo, no kellogs, no nike, no starbucks....
I think that Grandma is DC's wonder woman in disguise
Please don't be like Wonder Woman. That movie is even more overhyped than Black Panther.
"Her" and then they show A Hero 🤔 they really wanna cash in on the feminist angle
Yep looks way better than Wonder Woman
Wonder Woman is better than Captain Marvel
Okay, I get that the old woman is probably a Skrull, but punching an old lady in conjunction with "she's a hero"?
Hmm I feel like DC will win this one...twice (Wonder Woman and Shazam)
DC's Wonder Woman 1984
Feminist alert
This is some feminist shit right here, when is there going to be a male Superhero as the main character?
Well she looks more powerful than Wonder Woman.
Why did you punch an old woman
Trailer is boring. I just hope that the movie won't focus on the feministic bullshit. I hope they don't make her more powerful than anyone just because she's a woman and it's nice to give them an upper hand in power for once... I prefer reality. Unless the woman is a badass, like Wonder Woman. She is awesome.
You're just a bunch of Feminazis, that only wants female never get hit by anyone and yet want men to be hit in the face???. Misandristic Bullshiting!!!
Please don’t make this a women’s rights fueled movie, black panther tried a similar idea but it really didn’t work.
Old woman: You can't get my seat. Don't you see I am an old woman?
FINALLY a female marvel main character movie hero. Thank you! I got so excited I got shivers all over my body! Badass! 👌😍😍
Everybody knows it deep inside.Captain Marvel will break Wonder Womans record!!!😆
Lol dc fans realizing this is gonna easily best Wonder Woman at the Box office are starting to mock Brie Larson - an Oscar winning actress
Hopefully the female lead will go better for marvel than it did for Star Wars....cuz, you know, diversity and stuff.
.. I love Marvel this movie better be badass because this trailer looks so weak, least they could have went like Wonder Woman and got some exotic looking woman
I don't get most of you hating on this trailer. I mean, it misses two minutes by seconds, and yall are out here acting like that's an entire half of the movie!   Captain Marvel does show some emotion in this trailer: 0:54, 1:04 (smiling)1:31 (angry)1:28 (shock)And for another, do you really think that Marvel is just going to  throw away all of what it has spent a decade building up just to get her to beat Thanos? No, they wouldn't. The Russos(who are directing A4) and Kevin Feige know better.Also, I'd like to point out that the movie isn't out yet. And yall are out here making assumptions like "omg, she's going to be the next Kristen Stewart" "She's nothing like Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman" "they're going to make her a Deus Ex Machina" out of, may I repeat, A NEARLY TWO MINUTE TRAILER. Please. Grow a spine. Brie Larson didn't win an oscar for nothing. And if she's not like Wonder Woman, that's because she ISN'T Wonder Woman. She's Captain Marvel. And even though she's the most powerful, it doesn't give her the power to beat an entity with 6 Infinity Stones. Marvel is known for adding depth to their characters. Do you really think Captain Marvel's going to be an exception? We have Black Widow, Okoye, Gamora, Wasp, Valkyrie, and many more female heroines in the MCU who are loved and idolized. Yet Captain Marvel shows up, is proclaimed to be the most powerful because that's who she is, and suddenly everybody's lost their minds? Seriously. We're better than this.
Not impressed with the trailer to be honest. I get the impression that it's gonna be too much talking and storytelling more than action scenes. Gal Gadot somehow set the bar too high for women superheroes. 😑
Seems like female Green Lantern!!
Wonder Woman or Captain Marvel?
look I get it i'ts about time to play the classic "women are great too" card
The old woman scene does put a smile on my face
we supposed to see ultra super hero, but this is 80 year old women puncher.. MARVEL WHY? 1:31
females and males where everything must be gender equal.
Did captain marvel just punched an old woman in the face??
No hate intended but I'm actually  a little frustrated she's going to be playing a big role in A4. Don't get me wrong, I love seeing powerful women as superheroes, but in my opinion A4 should be about the closing chapter of the heroes we've fallen in love with over the last 10 years, not someone else's step into their place. Idk, that's just me though.
She punched a smiling old woman! Lmao
Felt bad for the old woman though
And it's not because she's a woman ot just seems boring and she doesn't look like she connected with her superpower very well
Well the feminists finally have penetrated Marvel Studios....
Female Green Lantern?
Skrulls ronan captian marvel slapping a old women and blockbuster take my money
And now it's here. Or should I say, feminist Brie Larson is.
D-Did she just punches an old woman in the face!!?
I kinda hate that shes a new character, coming to the mcu. But is the strongest from the start. While we have seen all these other characters grow up and become a hero. And shes just the strongest y'know. I dont care that shes Carol Danvers is a woman but with all the political shit going on it makes me look at her diffrently.
Please don't make this a feminist movie,  please don't make this a feminist movie,  please don't make this a feminist movie.
Do not make this a feminist shit show.
Disney feminism campaign is destroying Marvel as they did the same with Star Wars franchise with another female protagonist.
Captain marvel could be a great character. But hate the casting honestly. She doesn't looks strong, fierce and challenging at all. For example take gal gadot as an example for wonder woman
Feels kinda Wonder Woman-ish don't you think? Hopefully this movie delivers, I see a lot of negative comments here.
Yes now we have a female as a lead! Nice!
i dont understand why people complaining about her being not as sexy as wonder woman or black widow. she is not have to be.she has a simple attractiveness and thats enough for captain marvel. they're trying to give him a soldier image. not a stripper image
yes to women empowerment.😍
not impressed. So, SHAZAM is actually Supergirl with Hal Jordan's (Green Lantern's) origin story and hoping to cash in on the Wonder Woman vibe. Not working for me. Flat teaser/trailer as far as I can tell. Sorry Marvel guys, that's just what I feel. Couple of more trailers and I may be onboard. We'll see.
I am a DC fanboy but I need to admit wonder woman is nothing compared to this. It looks so good
I can already hear the interviewers: " How does it feel to be the lead female character in a superhero universe dominated by men?"
Poor trailer for a highly anticipated movie. Female green lantern.
nice to see her but didn't felt the same as when i saw *Wonder* *Woman* first time in trailer.
I'm glad we have a female superhero that even the men can be fanatics of. Sorry but I just can't get into female superheroes who run around in micro miniskirts while their male counterparts are all covered from head to toe.
Meh. Just another “I am woman, hear me roar” movie. Meh.
All womens are queens!!
More Wonder Woman than gal gadot
People had doubt about Gal Gadot being and amazing wonder woman.. and she was great.. same thing is going to be with Brie Larson. she's perfect for this role.. now go smash thanos up Carol!
Can we also get the female superheroes played by male actors? To be 100% sure we are not sexist, agist or racist, maybe Black Widow and Wonder Woman played by Bryan Cranston and Jaden Smith.
Doesn't look better then Wonder Woman, just saying
they made green lantern into a woman?
Feminists will still find something to complain about. Just watch.
An actual strong female lead that’s relevant to the lore and continuation of infinity war, not just cuz of some dumb libtard agenda
Is first hero storng woman in mavel
Oh yeah!!!!  The king of superhero movies is back!!!  Marvel 1000 - DC 2 & that 2 Im giving for their Wonder Woman effort & because Jason Momoa makes Aquaman look good!!
This is a very feminist movie. Should live up to the hype when it releases.
that's badass punching old woman
Marvel's 1st female stand alone movie and the most powerful character in MCU.
Any movie starring a woman is feminist propaganda apparently. Can misogynists just go back to reddit if they’re so pissed by the existence of a female superhero?
*On the information side, '20th Fox Century' 'Jean Grey' aka 'Phoenix' is a perfect tough for 'Thanos'👌. I never seen anyone matching to her power level except for the 'Cosmic Armoured Superman (CAS)' in Comics Version with the power of 'Nigh Omnipotence' and 'Nigh Omniscience' 💪💪💪☝✊👊👍😎. Also, I won't forget that 'MARVEL's' 'Scarlet Witch' and 'DC's' 'Wonder Woman' are damn powerful as hell, but NOT possibly higher than 'FOX's' 'Jean Grey'☝. Just imagine what if happens 'CAS' and 'Jean Grey' got collided 😓😯😨😨😨. (Oh, I know... the permanent end of Multiverse/Omniverse which is really a great idea🙋🙌😚! I would love that part of ending😏...)*
Rip  wonder woman 😁
People didn't talked like that about Gal Gadot in wonder woman because that movie wasn't hyped like this CM. This may hurt movie's business or it may make fortune at box office. 
1:30 Captain Marvel slapped that old woman into another multiverse.
Is this just for feminist movement? A Lady came and by the Hero, and do the job that man can't do at first. If is like that i'm not gona watch the movie. And the actress.....
She looks like what a female Captain Marvel would look like. The sad thing is, Captain Marvel *is supposed to be a man.* The character was *changed* into a female because of the feminist agenda. I have a feeling they are going to retire and replace Captain America with her. This does not reflect the history of Marvel. It reflects the tragedy that is feminism.
I've never been more sure that I'm attracted to women as I am right now
Wonder women has left the chat.
Strong women intimidate boys and excite men
Marvel presents: "The strong independent woman feminist fantasy". Coming to cinemas in 2019
Captain marvels a woman that's it I'm shooting up my local cinema lol
OK. This looks really good. And finally a female superhero that does not have to wear a "sexy" dress all the time.
But to make a movie where you have a female superhero where she can compensate for the half of the dead of the Avengers and much more to be more powerful then the all the infinite stones combine this it will be another super stupid fminist movie.
wtf is up with her punching an old woman? 😱
Captain  marvel better than wonder woman ..correct or not ???
women can destroy this world
Oh look it's superwoman
Did she just an old woman?!?! (yes I know that old woman might be a skrull)
Go re-watch the Wonder Women trailer. Trust me you'll feel better
I am still boycotting this movie because of Brie Larson being a feminist Nazi b****and my thoughts on the trailer is it looks like s***
The future is female bois!!! Could you believe if they actually had put in*male* instead. World war 3 would have started.
I love marvel  but thanks to the feminist movement 2017-18, they were probably forced to make a chick flick so they wouldn't protest.  This just might be Marvel's first flop since fantastic four
Punching up old women my kind of super hero
After 10 yearsand 20 movies MCU made it's first female lead superhero movie while DCEU did it in it's 4th movie.
If it wasn't for Marvel and Brie pushing this as "yeahhh women rule" I would be interested. Looks like a easy pass.
*and get this woman a blue red suit*
Wonder Woman would kick her ass, just sayin.
Man of Steel Woman Version.
A Movie For Women For Their Inspiration Let's Inspire Women They Need It Such Bullshit Man Feminism Really Did It's Job And Now We See It Even In Game's And Movie's Oh Yeah We See It Clearly Who Have Played Spiderman Game You Know What I'm Talking About Bro
Captain Marvel is a woman?! I recall Captain Marvel. I will pass but then I no longer watch super hero slug fests anyway. You've seen one, you've seen 'em all.
Can anyone appreciate this trailer, majority of the comments I've seen are just people complaining about how boring this damn trailer looks, its probably cause most people are use to seeing a comedic side for the majority of MCU Movies but dang, do you even read the comics, she is a dope female heroin
I will give it the benefit of the doubt atm but from their track record with female rolls in Hollywood movies, they will mary sue this character like THE FEMINIST AWAKENS. Till then i won't hold my breath.
That's a strong women character Rian Johnson and  Kathleen Kennedy.
You'll never reach wobder woman
Yep, this looks good. Although... female black pilot in 80s? How emersive.
LoL @ Wonder Woman
So my son didn’t want to see Wonder Woman because Wonder Woman is a woman. I’m trying to show him that women can be just as powerful as men so when we play video games, i always choose a woman character to kick his ass with. He agreed to see Captain Marvel with me but i haven’t told him that Captain Marvel is a woman yet. I’m just gonna let him figure it out.
Could you have picked an actress with less range? She has one blank expression on her face at all times. Also, fair warning Disney,  avoid the "The future is female" identity politics with this or you are going to lose money.
A female lead? The feminists are taking over! IM AN ADULT VIRGIN
Hottest and smartest female superhero ever brought to life... Brie Larson is just too damn good!!
Sorry Feminists not your day xD
What a powerfull woman ha ? 😂
As a movie, Infinity war is a collection of all these characters in one place, while, as a character, Captain Marvel is a blend of them. Infinity war was highly anticipated and it delivered. Let's hope the same goes for this very first female based MCU superhero movie. Come on, Cap! Leave Wonder woman in the dust!!!
Wait, marvel is feminist???
Have you guys realise that Captain Marvel's logo is so similar to the sign on Wonder Woman's Tiara?
Still I love wonder woman ♥
Captain Marvel and they coming out with Supergirl movie this year can we have a black superhero woman like Storm movie... Tf tf tf tf tf smfh
Why is it a woman?
Glad to see an ordinary woman can be a hero. Because in reality all hero we see everyday are just the ordinary one they just like us but what they do is different.
Who else thinks the woman from 1:31 is a skrull
The woman who will defeat Thanos, this will be interesting
Finally a good female super hero movie. 
*Punches old woman in the face*
1:31 when you are flirtatious with female seniors
This girl is better than Wonder Woman.
wonder woman who?
I'm sorry, she just doesn't fit, and she's boring. All the other characters we've been watching have their own brand of charisma, including the women. But my biggest beef with Captain Marvel is that I can already predict what is going to happen in the next movie, she's going to show up and take Thanos head on with no help, and the last stand of Captain America, Iron Man, and all the other guys who are leaving the MCU will be ruined. What would be better is if she shows up and teams up with those guys, and they work together, Captain Marvel being the wild card they need, just enough power to help them defeat Thanos,  then Captain America, Iron Man and anyone else who's going away will die in the glorious ending their characters deserve, and Captain Marvel can continue on to lead the MCU in phase 2. From a story telling standpoint that is a much better story, but unfortunately thanks to feminism, I don't think that's the story we're going to get 🙁. 
this will be great movie....watching this trailer i sense wonder woman movie's feeling
Punching old women in the face now Capt?
First we had to deal with all of the “black lives matter” stuff with black panther, now it’s gonna be abuncha feminist stuff with this, why can’t we just enjoy a movie without bringing this stuff into it
Honestly here I wasn't hooked. She didn't look badass. Wonder Woman first trailer way better!
What's made hero *punch old woman
Is marvel be only company that can pull off a bad ass female?
Wonder Woman Looks Amazing
Why at 1:30 does she punch the old woman
Hm... so marvel can cast a women as a male character but battlefield can't be historically accurate without being sexist? No this is reverse sexism, I'm boycotting marvel
Literally just like Wonder Woman
In a battle between this and Wonder Woman... I'll go for Wonder Woman. you know why. Yes you know😂
only in Hollywood do they make a women  super then a man,...
I care absolutely nothing about this movie. I haven't seen any women superhero movie and I am not about to start now.... NEXT
First and only female superhero in the MCU comes - “raaa feminist agendaaa huhu” 😂😂😂
This movie its man of steel + wonder woman im marvel fan
More feminist nonsense. Superheros are men and NOT women. Men rule and women drool.
So Basically Its Superwoman
Why is it whenever there is a female character you guys always say that this movie is "going to fail"??? What is wrong with you people.
1:30 Just casually beating on a old women (but i seriously thinks that is a Skrull)
You know it is 2018 when ALL main characters in an american movie are either female or non white... But I'm perfectly confident that this era of political correctness is quickly drawing to an end...
Punching women NO 👎
So I thought people were exaggerating when the said she had the same expression throughout the whole trailer, and they were! 1:44 she changes her expression. Boom. If this movie bombs, it's because she has no expression and no character, not because she's a woman.
So, basically she's superwoman of marvel universe.
I friggin love Brie Larson. But I really hope they leave out the Marxist / feminist B.S. She's an incredible actress that can really open up a hero character. Let Brie do her thing, no agendas, and this will be an awesome movie.
I’m... kinda disappointed. it looks bland. for the first female superhero movie in the marvel cinematic universe I was expecting a bit more. :(
Wait....Is this like the female version of Top Gun?
I so sick of Marvel geeks and nerds saying that this movie sucks because "appealing to gender". That's BS and you know that, I'm so sick and tired of them assuming that. I'm not talking about everyone but those people need t stfu sometimes and have no clue what their talking about. I understand that movies sometimes blatantly based upon that and they suck. But don't assume every movie with a female role will suck. That's continuing to prove a point to the feminist indirectly. OMG this is just like the New Ghostbusters movie instead people actually like it but were still spectical. I know its their personal opinion but don't slander this movie. Don't say I don't know what I'm talking, because I do but not everything.
Captain Marvel: punching old women since 1994
Awesome Powerful woman 😍😍
In terms of recent Marvel/DC movies, I have mixed feelings. Wonder Woman was great, but Justice League was garbage. Age of Ultron only made the Avengers franchise go downhill, which is why I haven't watched Infinity War; and Civil War was stupid. Homecoming ruined Spiderman. Although, Black Panther was pretty good. Anyway, for a Marvel trailer, this actually looks great. I have high hopes for Captain Marvel, but I won't be surprised if they ruin it.
Seems like Gal Godot set the bar too high for female super heroes.
1000 times better captain marvel dc wonder women 👌👌👌
She is supposed to be a female Captain America. They do not smile people; they are boy/girl scouts!!!
Feminists! Brace for impact!
meh....wonder women wannabe..
Female super hero movie. You know its going to be awful
Oh amazing, another strong woman appears in theaters. It's not politically correct, it's a coincidence guys.
Well Wonder Woman got competition Captain Marvel is gonna steal the Thunder....💥
Picture it!  Gal Gadot and Patty Jenkins are just having a good time filiming Wonder Woman 2 and someone runs on set and screams “THE CAPTAIN MARVEL TRAILER IS OUT!!” Everyone stops what they’re doing. Gal and Patty look at each other and nod affirmatively. The whole filming crew walk into a room and they pull up the trailer. When they’re done everyones laughing and then the camera slowly starts zooming in on Gal Gadot until it stops on just her face. She slowly begins to compose herself and then in her sultry Israeli accent she smiles and says “LETS SEE WHAT SHE’S GOT..”
Looks more than a DC movie than marvel .. I was more hyped over wonder woman than this 😓
From what i heard, this woman is the only one can beat the thanos in next avangers sequence
Shit, this mental picture of an old woman being bludgeoned.....is now etched in my mind forever.....
But seriously, she's a vile woman, and a bad actor overall.
I'm not really sure. Marvel is a great studio with cool and funny characters but they seem to have a history of bland female characters with no personality. Hopefully this will be different.
Let’s go baby this woman is goin to kill Thanos or Squirrel girl I don’t know but let’s go baby I am ready and hype for this year
Imagine her facing wonder woman 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Only 42 million views in 4 weeks. Pathetic. All feminist movies and super hero movies are going to suck. People like antiheros nowadays. Venom is my favorite superhero. We need more movies like that, not these kind of farty-brat movies.😂
To prove that biological differences between man and women
Cool, ive always wanted to see a superhero movie about a 40 year old woman playing a mildly annoyed, bored teenager.
How is no one talking about how she socked an old woman to the face?
Her powers look kinda generic and this isn't any better than WonderWoman. I think I'll just pass on this one.
Im torn between my love of blockbuster and hatred of women. Can I like and dislike? Seriously though not to shabby.
I hate when a women is the  hero. 😰
It's about a cool Aura and strong female alpha character if Marvel want to replace Stark with Denver as a leader for the future MCU.
this is waaay better than wonder woman, RIP DC
Just so that Wonder Woman is not the only woman super hero. This is a feminist's wet dream!
Thank god it's a woman
*In my opinion, I'm not excited of this trailer😔. By the way, the actress seems worthless for such powerful character😒... (Why Super Heroins are getting skinny and skinnier recently😓😫. First 'Wonder Woman' and now 'Captain Marvel'😧... Why... why... they seems like gonna die out of diet😢😖🙇. I mean why😥... I hate skinny girls😭😭😭.)* 
That old woman is an evil lady
Marvel has made every movie the best. But they are gonna suck at first women superhero movie
wonder woman better?
Why there is no wonder woman? 🤔
1) I hope this film doesn't include an social warrior justice / feminist B.S.. (looking at you Disney Star Wars)
Wonder woman is much better than captain marvel...
I really hope the whole film isn't a super serious pro feminist movie and has some humour like other marvel movies, Carol Danvers is a great character in the comics and shows you can have a stong female character with a personality.... Hope the mcu was taking notes
Wonder Woman  84 = MS. Marvel Girl
To be honest i got more excited seeing 90's Nick Fury than Captain Marvel herself.I'm not gonna judge from now though.The same happened with Wonder Woman and Gal slayed it!
HER O subliminal message to all the feminists out there...
It look cool until you realise it’s just eye rolling feminist propaganda
I did not even know that the great Capt Marvel was even a woman, it sounds like a name for a superman
Thanos better use protection I've seen a lot of women destroy man. Lol for the not so fast ( child  support an/or some cases alimony)
Why did she punch an old lady? Because she's not Wonder Woman.
Can we stop acting like Captain Marvel is a main superhero that we've loved for all time and blah blah blah.  No one even knows or cares about her.  Name your top 20 favorite heroes...exactly , lets stop acting like she is Wonder Woman.
Wonder woman was a ok movie I liked It, This Trailer IS better Alone!! Fury:  "WE HAVE WE KNOW IDEA WHAT THREATS ARE OT THERE!" (AKA  THANOS) This is not the best trailer but it is off coming off  A3 hype!! I hope to live and see this Woman Take the Fight to Thanos!  THANOS  DESTROYED HALF THE UNIVERSE! BUT HE ALSO PISSED OFF THE AVENGERS AND NOW CAPTAIN MARVEL!
*punches an old woman*
This film is more girl power nonsense promoting feminism through feminist Brie Larson and feminist character Captain Marvel. 
Punches the hell out of a elderly women
Way better than wonder women.
Only NPC can watch this feminist crap.
I love the fact that that the strongest MCU Hero is a Female
The battle of names between Captain Marvel vs Shazam will happen in 2019, but actually when it comes to heroines it's Wonder Woman vs Captain Marvel instead.
i wish captain marvel are much pretier than her... i mean she is okay, but i imagine a sharp jawline face like angelina jolie or bella hadid or jennifer lawrence or megan fox. u know... a super pretty woman ❤❤
It looks very good, however I doubt it could beat Wonder Woman 🙅🏻‍♀️
uhm ? Captain Feminist?
Marvels Feminist the movie
Ffs why the Main character is a "woman"
woman is skrull in the train
That old woman was probably thanos' girlfriend or mom or something.
Look boring,why Marvel actresses all look old?Lily Collins or Teresa Palmer should take up the role,they are more beautiful.Wonder Woman is popular because Gal Gadot is good looking.
Still wont top Wonder Woman
Looks kinda bland maybe a bad trailer. Hope this doesn't get the black panther treatment and everyone automatically thinks it's amazing just because it's the first female entry.
Seriously i'm tired of these feminist agenda movies. smh
Nearly 9 thousand dislikes. Are these the pansies that don't want to see a female in a lead super hero movie? Looks pretty good to me.
Oh goody another movie with a female lead, oh yay what fun.  I will not be watching that, tried to watch the updated version of Ghostbusters, hated, same with Wonder Woman, didn't like that either.  If studios want to movies with females in a leading role, go for it.  I'm a woman and these movies bored me.
Next version of the wonder woman ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Marvel, Women of Steel
People are saying this trailer is bad just because Captain Marvel is a woman. I bet you won’t be saying that if a Black Widow or a Scarlet Witch movie came out.
The teaser itself is giving Vibes of origin story just like wonder woman while Brie said in one of her interviews that it isn't origin story. 
PC Culture: How dare you!? You are just hating the trailer because it's a woman superhero, and you hate women!!
What is this garbage? Does this woman know how to make facial expressions? Fyi women arn't tough and having her walk around with that stupid "tough guy" look on her face does not make her intimidating.
Finally! Marvel's Wonder Woman is here!!! And I think I saw Agent Coulson.
Grandma:are u wonder woman?
Where is Wonder Woman?
Looks cool, I just hope it’s not some feminist crap like we see in a lot of movies these days. Wonder Woman was a good movie, hopefully it will be as good.
The super woman of marvel
Women superhero’s are trash, stick to cooking and cleaning you slags!!
1:49 is that a female SUPER SAIYAN?!?!
I hate that whole HER --> to A HERO crap. Why do they have to make a big deal out of the main hero/lead being a woman as if they are the first ones to do it?
the least attractive female character in all Marvel movies.
I have never heard of a woman be called “captain” before.
Hello Wonder Woman marvel version
It took this long for a female superhero from marvel....lol
I'm going to say this. good for marvel for giving a female hero its first  marvel female super hero film. we DC fans waited 75 years for wonder woman and we did it. you guys have a cool hero here. also waiting for a decent super girl  film because the series to me sucks thanks to the feminist they have as ep.
I hear Feminists typing.
Wonder woman might be better... But I'm a Marvel fan and I'm on team cap.
I’m just so not sold on this movie. Like exactly what are the selling points? There’s a woman in the lead role. Check. It’s marvel studios so we know the movie will be entertaining and well shot. Check. And Sam Jackson. Besides that, why should I want to see this movie?
1:30 did she just disrespect that old woman?!!!😂😂😂
If it's anything close to Wonder Women I am there
This is actually like the first female marvel based movie!!!😍🙌🏽 I cant wait to see it
Captain Mar... y Sue! How come you didn't go even more progressive and make her a "they" pronoun using non-binary person? The female hero thing isn't revolutionary anymore. Get with the times!
Wonderwomanwonderwomanwonderwoman... Why the stupids are comparing that character with Captain Marvel? You don't understand that this is another comics universe? THIS IS CAPTAIN MARVEL. 
captain feminist
1:40 BatWomen O.o
captain marvel >>>wonderwoman
Women are heroes now. This is how it is. The men are weak very weak. The women are the strongest. Even these movies show it very clearly including my favourite Wonder Woman. Even women are physically very strong just give them a chance. Women can also defeat man in the most strongest man competition.
Oh hey, its superwomen. Cool.
The new wonder woman trailer looks amazing ..
Wonder Woman is ❤
I did not know that woman could be captains. 🆑🆎⏯⏩◀️
It's  a shame I'll have to wait for the DVD, I wanted to support Marvel Studio's first female lead movie.
Weak ass trailer. And she's gonna save the universe? Where's Wonder Woman?
oh... wonder woman is too better than this lady. and also SHAZAM IS REAL CAPTAIN MARVEL.
You had enough? The reason I know, I have the original 1940s Captain Marvel comic and the way it was explained to me is, he is an open superhero, he could be a man, woman dolphin ,chicken, in essence of what I am saying, he has no patent. But the original, was a man and a boy.
Didnt love how she sounds " I'm not what you think I am" sounded like some tween kardashian girl... You a woman! roar! Put some bass in that voice something. lol
I know she's a skrull but imagine someone with no knowledge of skrull's reaction to the old-woman punching bit.
Hmmm every marvel film trailer before this has had universal acclaim from audiences. This one comes along and happens to feature a female protagonist and now people choose to hate, I wonder why 🙄
A captain marvel movie and Mary poppins movie in the same year? The feminists are taking over!!
I need to watch this movie because the media have not told me how strong women and men are weak, for almost a whole 5 minutes.
A superhero woman main characeter  ... Im sorry marvel, this will not end well
Wonder Woman was first lol
Can't wait to take my little one to see this. She's always super stoked to see female heroes.
And women and stuff
Why not boy become captain marvel heheh i not satisfied if woman fight thanos maybe captain marvel woman like wonder woman
I don't know why but am kinda relating this to Superman (man of steel) and Wonder Woman! And march 2019 is too far too.
Watch iT but..... reallly.... hmmmmmmmmmmmmm turn into flaming woman already and kick Some beautifull assses and in slowmotion 😂
WHY is everyone hating on this trailer?! I had the same feeling when guardians of the galaxy and ant man came out, because they’re different than the “traditional” marvel movies. However, look how those ended up doing...Y’all have to understand that this is the FIRST time there’s a woman lead in an MCU movie...they have to change it up to accommodate. If you’re a REAL marvel fan you’re gonna still watch it no matter what. Ok that’s all :)
Iron-Woman Soon
This will flop, the woman who is playing captain marvel not even close to acting as the character in the comics
Finally a marvel female superhero movie!!
I am  simple, i watch a trailer i see a woman as the main actor,i pause the video i click dislike and continue my day.
White women are the best
Apocalypse chokes Raven - promoting violence against women! Captain Marvel socks old lady - promoting violence against the aged! No, promoting violence against Skrulls *disguised* as old ladies.
Almost 50yrs of comic book history to work with and they give us a woman captain marvel.
*_Superwomen : A Solider Among Humans_*
who is freaking Captain Marvel? the woman?
All the people saying this movie looks bad... Come on, be honest. You just dont like it because it's a female lead and the actress has a differing opinion than yours. It's okay. You can admit you're a sexist man baby.
Bring Wonder woman.
Classic woman and her mysterious childhood movie
Finally, a woman main characters hero movie made by marvel!
R.I.P Wonder Woman.
Woow! 😲 Marvel does exist? First time realizing it. I've always thought it's just a comic or studio or something, lol. And Captain Marvel is a female? Not male?! 😆😅🙌💪👏👍👍
Like for Captain Marvel and Reply for Wonder Woman 1984..💥
i was hyped to see waiting for that trailer .. but it kinda look like a green lantern corps female version ....
Why Did She 👊👊👊 The Woman?? Is She Thano... Leave It!! 👊
Can we please stop with all this white young woman on white grandma woman violence. It's completely out of control!
What's with the her thing? I seriously hope this movie stays out of the whole "it's a woman" "the future is female" type stuff. Black Panther gave me a bad taste in my mouth with the blatant racial undertones that weren't needed at all
Yeah I'm just gonna stick with my Wonder Woman lol
First!  This looks like a female superman!
Yeah dude, we know its a woman....been seeing movies with MC woman for about 30 years now.... nothing revolutionary there.
So this to Captain Marvel one female and one male wow LOL...
Whelp. I'll catch hell but she looks like a Mass Effect Andromeda female 😂
On your left Wonder Woman.
My mom is real superwomen.
The best of women
Oh so a woman can punch an old lady, but a man cant??? Oh ok...ok...ever had to wait for 10 minutes for one of those to cross the road?
Glad she looks like a woman instead of Carl Manvers in the comics.
A wanna be Wonder Woman  movie.
Marvel's Wonder Woman
“I’m not what you think I am...” a biological woman?
That's weird, I thought actors were supposed to, you know, act????? I've seen more facial motion on the Easter Island statues than on this woman.
In Today's world if you say anything bad about something with a woman in it, you're automatically considered a sexist and you're labeled someone who hates women. Idk why but it is what it is. I thought the trailer was pretty good.
Next scene: *hits an old woman
Wonder Women > Captain Marvel
Really medoicre trailer. The actress Brie Larson somehow remindes me of Kristen Stewart with zero face impressions. And she is supposed to win Thanos? No way. She just doen't seem to be a Marvel hero. The best part of the trailer is Jude Law. Let him fight Thanos, this will be worth watching. As to compare with oethers women characters: The Black Widow is a lot more attractive & had resonably portraided her character. The Wonder Woman from DC (Gal Gadot) is still better in acting her role. Brie is just not the right choice for this role. The music cover in also very regular.
if the movie wasn't about a kitchen  ..im not interested in watching a movie with a female protagonist let alone a superhero
Female Green Lantern. Cool.
OMG a Caucasian female heroine ! Wow
Feminist propaganda at its peak
Who's ready for complaints about a woman in a leading role?
1:31 seriously ? You hit old women ? Shame captain 😑
Anyway hopefully this will be as awesome as Wonder Woman. I'm pumped.
She beat an old lady😂😂😂wtf...an why they couldn't choose a better looking white woman or ambiguous black octaroon?
A Women... Movie ruined
I don't mind women superheroes but making her the most powerful of all avengers is just wrong. It's just playing in the hands of femenazis
I hate the part from 1:41 to 1:43 because I get some feministic women empowerment vibe to it. You already know opening day most of the audience will be female and 90% of them will be there to feel empowered instead of just wanting to see the new marvel movie.
It’s like feminist Green Lantern...
They really thought this would beat wonder woman😂😂
dc- we have wonder woman
amazing....now i can see something instead of wonder woman BS...loved this trailer
I respect woman 
They should not make woman superhero movies like wonder woman or captain marvel.
This is going to be so much better than wonder woman.
Will everyone who's so hurt that SHAZAM has a movie even tho originally it was settled that Captian Marvel is now Marvels Heroine and Shazam is awesome no matter the name...can we just appreciate that comic movies are getting better despite anything...yea DC drops the ball alot but there trying and Marvel has hits an Misses...I wasnt a fan of Age Of Ultron or Black Panther YEAH I WASNT!!! Just like Suicide Squad and Wonder Women wasnt so hot on me either. Were in a new movie watching era where we can sit back pop are 3D glasses on buy over expensive snacks...*I dont* and just enjoy that we have the most epic cross over since Daffy Duck met Bugs Bunny...*YEAH THAT WAS A THING* so stop with the hate on both ends and let us rejoice that comic book movie trailers and the movie itself is at an all time high!!! Only thing I'll criticize this movie for is if Stan Lee isnt gonna Cameo it as he rightfully deserves even if he didnt make the heroes Marvel wouldn't exist if not for his part....and I finally find out how Nick lost his eye....youtube nation SHUT YP AND TAKE MY $13.00 Or $5 on Tuesday...I'm an AMC Srubs member after all...
> To all the people saying this is a ripoff of Wonder Woman: Different characters, background, motivation and development. Stop.
Like wonder women
Woman and captan !?? 😂😁😀
Still women hero is bad
Also, stop telling women to smile.
ummmmmm .. weakest trailer for an MCU film in a long time. Stating she is a 'HERO' pretty much sums up the concern Feige had with releasing an unknown Marvel character. This is going to be the MUCs first female lead film, and already with a heavy support cast, the Kree's and Colson and Samuel L Jackson, this film definitely needs the help because unlike Wonder Woman which had no other DC cameos or heavy support casting, this film seems  it will do well, but come short of expectation. Unless an Avenger(s) makes a cameo, the film will receive the big opening not because it's Captain Marvel but because it's an MCU film. Black Panther and Infinity Wars take this years box office. It will be unfortunate for the MCU if Captain Marvel doesn't make the $800m like Wonder Woman did, because everything for Brie Larson is riding on her being able to replace Robert Downey Jr (as per Kevin Feige's announcement of the MCU moving forward) as the new face of the MCU, which I doubt it as Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemisworth, MUC's trinity are going to need big actors to fill their shoes. Black Panther and Doctor Strange can do it and I would prefer Spiderman, but Brie Larson, sorry, Captain Marvel wasn't a top tier character in the Marvel Comics and she won't be in the MCU. Male characters dominate the MCU genre, unless your Wonder Woman, you won't break that stereotype as she ahs for all female leads in film.
The future is female indeed.
The main character is female 🤢🤢
I know a lot of people are gonna say I’m being sexist but just listen to me for a second how many marvel superheroes are there? Ok so got hoe many there are? Now divide between men and woman what gender is there more? I found that there was more men the women. Now I’m not saying that being a girl superhero is a bad thing, I’m just saying that I think captain marvel should be a man because there are more men superheroes then women.
Well she's one of the less quippy, more "all businiess all the time" female characters, I'm glad they didn't make her silly or funny to sell her as the female Ironman, or innocent/ignorant of the world like a female Thor, I can see the jokes happening arround her, not by her.
Seems to be better than wonder woman......
I am disappointed with that old woman hitting scene...whatever they show, may be that old woman is a bad guy in disguise, but she actually hit her... that's bad! :-/
Have they changed the origin story of Miss Marvel? The trailer seems to imply that she was born that way and was always superhuman. She actually got her powers from Captain Marvel, the alien she was in love with. Brie Larson is a poor choice. She has what I call a suicide face. A single look, no change, no emotion, just the constant look of someone who wants to kill themselves. It’s all the rage today with female models. There are much better actresses out there who could have been cast in this role.
Well women's day for you.
So before calling people Sexist. Realize that comic book fans love strong Female characters and will stand by them. It's when you say "Strongest Avenger Captain Marvel. You're wrong 
Ha ha ha strong female protagonist makes it a good movie, right?
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! How awesome does this look. By the way I think that old woman captian marvel punched was a skrull because they can form into different people. Also I'm glad nick fury is in this!!!
Marvel being taken over by feminists?
Aight cool guys but like why did it take 5 comments for me to see something about an old woman getting punched in the trailer (even if she is just a disguise.)
Anyone Noted On The Date of release of this Movie i.e. 8th March 2019...There is International Women's Day..😍...What a Job Marvel!!
For everyone who think Brie is running the show here..she’s not..she understands that her feminist ideology isn’t what sells tickets..marvel for the most part has been apolitical so they’re running with substance of story rather than the dilemma pf trying to shove an ideology down people’s throats like Star Wars has..marvel is running the show not politics
Endlessly highlighting her superior strength sounds likes some kind  of nervous over compensation 'oh you're gonna like her because she's so strong and she can fly and project bolts of energy and she's a woman but stronger that EVERYONE else, even all of those men superheroes.'
captain feminist.
Why is captain marvel a woman ? Feminism is ruining hollywood...
That was 60% super man +30% Nick fury and 10% beating an old woman....
She doesnt make a convincing hero. She's too young and "clueless". A more mature and battle scarred woman would be much more believable. Like a Sharon Stone or Melanie Griffith. Yeah, I think I'll pass on this one.
I bet no original Captain Mar-vell the male version will be shown because most of the audience doesn't know him. And there was also a black female Captain Marvel before this one. Also a blue one. Most don't realize that she took up the name in honor of the first Captain Mar-vell. She was afraid to live up to the legacy that he created by being a hero. It was Steve Rogers who helped her decide that it was time for her to do it.
Feminist propaganda. Yay I'm a woman...look at me! 
no more female captain. enough  female captain lead me and tell me what to do all night long
Plot twist: thanos used the reality stone to look like an old woman
Oh god please don’t be preachy feminist movie.
Did I see captain marvel give an old woman a good slapping
feminist masturbation.
now curiousity iz getting higher day by day..sure watch stuff before avengers4...super strong gal than wonderwoman...MCU just love u
Wasn't she a pilot? How did she pass BASIC training? I mean there's literally women walking around everywhere who would be better cast for this role.
So basically a female version of captain america.
Not much of a fan of the character. But the trailer itself is.. Ok-ish compared to any of the avengers trailers, even Wonder woman pulled off a better trailer than this.
Another snowflake women empowerment movie. There i said it. Now get triggered
Yes!!! Finally a female has a lead role in MCU!
feminism. Feminists must be destroyed. We will not conform! We will
you can rest assure that captain marvel is going to  be far bigger hit than that stupid accented dumb stripper wonder woman.Just look at how marvel movie collections are far better than dumb stupid dark dc movie collections.Also dc needs to get some good directors for their films like jon favreau,russo brothers,joss whedon who gave marvel its biggest hits.But instead dc is stuck with dumb directors like zack snyder who doenst know anything about good film making.
Bat women in 1:40
Inventense algo mejor y no le crean a las feministas, ellas cagan Marvel.
I just realized this is the first female marvel movie, well it looks like it's gonna be a good one.
I'm so tired of women who are supposed to be superheroes but look and sound like they'd fall over in a stiff breeze. Brie is an okay actor, but as Captain Marvel who's supposed to be the most powerful superhero in the MCU? She looks like Hulk could take her out in two swings. And that's being generous. I'll pass.
Poor oldwoman there... 😂
Why every woman thinks they need to be blonde I have no clue...
Superman + Flash + Shazam + Wonderwoman > Todos los vengadores
Oh yeah, Marvel's first female superhero movie!
Super feminist are trying to kill all men!
It’s all going well until you demolish an old woman with a right hook
Nothing at all against good female leads, I'm looking forward to it. Just please, don't inject any identity politics bullshit into it.
Never underestimate a superpowered woman because you don't know what comes next if you confront a lady like Captain Marvel
Now in the comics there was two captain marvels if I recall correctly, one was a male another was a female; this is if you were questioning why is she a female while the comics show that he was a male, the male cap. Marvel was the first to appear in the story the female Cap. Marvel followed next after male Cap. Marvel was killed.
But when I saw her hitting elderly women, my opinion changed.
I don't know anything about Captain Marvel other than apparently she used to be a he? Or... that it doesn't matter because Captain Marvel are several people? Or something? I'm happy that it's a woman but I wouldn't be mad if it was a man. I don't care about the gender though it is refreshing to see a lady as a main hero in MCU movies. I didn't get any hype feelings from the trailer but that might be because I don't know anything about the character... I hope it turns out to be good. I want it to rock but this trailer doesn't make me any more interested in the movie...
I wouldn't scroll too far down. Not unless you want to witness yet another feminist vs anti-feminist argument.
She is like a female neo, from the matrix. Not because she is hell strong. But because she has no facial expressions.
People want to see a good movie. Just because the main character is female you don't have to suddenly twist the story to be somehow "female" 🙄 just make a good movie right.
The old woman was a skrull
that forcing woman its ok for me.. but that bad acting omg...
Should have cast an black female! This would be better for the people and critics!!! It would be more hyped up!
Bad bgm, wonder woman has the best bgm
Captain Marvel is supposed to play a big role in the Marvel universe upcoming story but I didn't get the charisma I was waiting for, I'm not even a big DC fan but I think Wonder Woman introduction was way more powerful and there goes my dream of a short haired Captain marvel cause yeah everybody know heroins have wavy hair ...
*Captain feminist*
Well seeing as how this character exists, only so DC couldn't use the name captain marvel, with the original and more interesting owner of the name e.g Shazam, I can't see this being any good. This character has as much depth as the Kardashian's claim to fame. Petty of Marvel, fearing DC having a character with their company name in the title would undermine them. How about just make up an original interesting female superhero, instead of just ripping off wonder women and repacking the character with captain marvel name.
Great teaser....Hopefully we get a SpiderWoman Easter Egg near the end of the movie..!
A "her"o really? Because we've never had any females in the marvel movies
Theory: That old woman she punches isnt even a skrull she just took her damn seat
Feminists across the globe just orgasmed for the first one in their lives
Watch this movie get so much love because it has a female protagonist
I dont like the fact she is a woman but stronger than for example hulk.
Captain Marvel= Wonder woman of DC.
*Company makes a female superhero movie*
Comments section: "Let me speak with authority on how much this movie sucks having never seen it. Here's my prepared assumption that you think that I think it sucks because it features a female lead (which is probably more accurate than I'm willing to acknowledge or self-interrogate). Here's the reasons that isn't true." Jesus people. You've literally seen a trailer and that's it. Calm your mammories, take a walk, wait until you've seen the film before making a bellend of yourself on the internet.
I’m just here to laugh at the people with the “female empowerment” comments. Or the “she isn’t a good actor, she has a blank face the whole trailer”😂😂😂
Thanks. Completely took a dump all over all the other characters. I mean, like, what the hell's the point of all the other characters when you have one that's god-like? Also, what the hell was that at the end with HERo? Feminist much? Psssh. Done with you.
I thought Captain Marvel was a man. And that woman was called Ms. Marvel.
Did she just punched an old woman... :angry emoji:
As long as she isn't as naive of a character as Wonder Woman was I'll be fine. I like my heros and heroines knowing they're saving faulty people, not stunned at every turn about how flawed humans are  despite living for literally thousands of years. That was my only problem with Wonder Woman
Walmart Wonder Woman
wonder woman wig was found injured with critical condition.
Being the first female, I really want this movie to be good but......my god that trailer was bad. Brie has zero emotions or presence.
I like how they threw a subliminal to girls/women.  When unveiling the word “her”....then the fog cleared....”her” turned into “A hero”
Wonder Woman done right.
Wow. I grew up reading comics & loved Ms. Marvel aka Carol Danvers (at least until she was turned into "Binary"...I hated that move & the costume). Of all the female superheroes, she was my absolute favorite. Seeing her in a live action film makes me misty eyed! By the way, Marvel, perfect casting!!!! It's gonna be great seeing Mar-Vell in a live action movie finally as well!
If this movie can't beat wonder women,dc take this one for the win.
The same DC fans said in suicide squad and batman vs superman. Trailer looked good but what actually happened? Razzie nominations - an alien territory for MCU movies. I'm not even a fan of both MCU and DCEU but DC fans should stop bitching when you can't even make a decent movie save for wonder woman.
All I hope for this film is that, if it's good, it won't be considered good just because it has a female lead; and if it's bad, it won't be considered bad just because it has a female lead.
The future is female!!!
A woman that killed a Titan!
YES more female heroes
Guessing the old woman is a skrull
Really, no one is going to talk about how Captain Marvel just socked some old woman in the face? 1:30
1:27 SO... She just punched an old woman in the face are we gonna ignore that or...
Great trailer it about time for a woman superhero in the mcu I think brie Larson is going to be fabulous  mcu trailers have to be always serious it just a teaser but anyway awesome trailer can't wait till March
ok so the original captain marvel (the male captain marvel) doesn't exist in the MCU this is fine but what would have been cooler is the story of her being human then becoming miss marvel due to some radiation emitting from captain marvel or him using some alien tech to heal her from a accident then him dying (perhaps halfway through the movie)and she takes the mantle of captain marvel that would have made way more sense and it would have made a lot more fans happy but i'm still looking forward to this movie (i hope there is at least a reference to the original captain marvel and not in a line similar to "why would you think i was a man women can be captains too" just do it like he's her relative or friend back on her home planet)
women should be in the kitchen, not actors in superheromovies
Marvel is a badass, they know we want the trailer so much, so they give us too little details in this trailer , only give us the details we already knew, love it. Brie looks so good in that costume I didn't expect that, she looks like the character that pops out from the comic the same vibe I get when I see Gal in a wonder woman's costume. Can't wait to see the movie and of course, the end credit...
Crap movie, are they trying to provide alternative to wonder women lol
Gonna be honest. This trailer was sorta shit. Also you can’t say people hate the trailer because it’s a woman, I think it goes the other way, people will rate it way higher just because it’s a woman, it’s just like what happened with black panther. Black panther was a terrible film and easily the worst in the MCU, I didn’t hate it because it was a black led film, people loved it because it was a black led film. I believe that if a film of black panthers quality was a white cast then it would have gotten shit reviews
Seems a lil bit flat. It doesnt set the hype like wonder woman did
Yes! This is it! The world can finally witness an actual female-lead superhero movie, and not a wannabe 'wonder' one.
Bad trailler... I beat on the face to an old woman what values....:(
I am hyped for WonderWoman84,  Shazam,   Aquaman.
It's a boring masculine feminist with only one possible facial expression.
The Captain Marvel I grew up with was a guy who drove around with his mentor in a Winnebago. But... I do recall from the depths of my childhood that he had a female counterpart. Clearly that's the one we're getting here, and probably a good thing; it lays all the pathetic childhood memories to rest.
i actually have no idea who this woman is
Yes yes yes Thanos are you ready to my baby girl power??? )))) and i want to say wonder woman WE HAVE CAPTAIN MARVEL ))) thank you Kevin Feige for everything that you did and do for us. Just dont stop )))
Oh great, more feminist propaganda. Thanks, Jews! What would we do without your incessant urge to shove your decadent beliefs down our throats?
Disappointed in the lack of hype, Captain Marvel is my favourite female superhero!
Wonder woman disliked this
Honestly Wonder Woman looks a billion times better compared to this..
The Funeral of DC' Wonder Woman will be held on March 2019...!
To all the butthurt men: Flight of the Conchords - Hurt Feelings has just become your theme song. Now shut the hell up and let a woman handle this.
Who needs captain marvel when we've got wonder woman already?
Captain Marvel should have been a black female.
Oh look, a movie about a strong feminist woman with 40x more likes than dislikes. Maybe the problem with some of the others wasn't that they were about strong women.
Bat-Woman Soon
Kind of a mixture of captain America & wonder woman
This was shit. By the way, Captain Marvel should've had a man actor. More menacing and better. A woman? Not as good because her acting isn't that good (this trailer also sucked). Marvel kinda running down but that okay.
First female hero and main character in a Marvel movie and all these comments are hating on it already. Speaks volumes.
I am hoping this movie is good and doesn't have the whole "feminist agenda" due to Brie Larson being an over Zelous Feminist. I hope this movie doe's good. With good scripit this movie should be great and would watch. But if Marvel is going to go back to "Get Woke Go Broke" then i am not watching this movie. So let hope this isn't a huge failer.
This chick is terrible, very one dimensional...she's the female Momoa.
So....DC Makes the best female superhero films and Marvel? Not so much.......
Of course Feminist Brie Larson arrives to save us all from Thanos.
I don't think I will be watching this movie. It looks like a boring fest. I know there must be more to it and I hope there is, but man, this just seems like a cake to feed the so called feminists and their woman superhero starved selves. Trust me, I don't like DC but wonder woman was a lot more interesting than this. Especially with a character like Diana's, whose actress did so much justice to the character and made me fall in love. Brie just seems too flat and a Mary sue at best. Marvel, what have you done...
I'm wondering why she gets to have the first female leading marvel movie when she hasn't been in any previous movies???
Nice to see that they cast a jewish woman.
Uh...Brie Larson 🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷 gained so much weight since Skull Island.    Look at Scarlett Johansson and the Other Female Actresses. Hell, even Gwyneth Paltrow is in better physical shape than Brie Larson. Cate Blanchett puts Brie Larson TO SHAME!!!!
Looks like feminist rubbish again
Thanos cant hit women because he's a real gentleman
it has potential hopefully she portrays like shes powerful like gal gadot does with wonder woman, but it still bothers me that everything that happened in ifinity war will be undone in some way
I'm shocked when she punched the old woman
she just hit a old woman
Nah wonder woman is better
Now I see why Marvel took so long to release a trailer for this movie. For myself, the trailer fell a little short of expectations. If this movie isn’t better than Wonder Woman, does that qualify as a failure for Marvel?
I think feminists disliked the trailer.
captain marvel vs. wonder woman
What a horrible video thumbnail. Her facial expression/eyes looks so disinterested and empty. They could have picked a way better thumbnail. BTW, I hope they try to follow the example of Wonder Woman and make this a good movie :p .
*Slaps elderly woman* The hero we All wanted.
Strong Female Protagonist!
Eh. I'm afraid to say I am not feeling it, because then that would mean I hate women.
FINALLY,The Teaser Trailer of MCU'S first female lead SUPERHERO is released....
Releases on international women’s day
totally unbelievable.  white and a female
Punching of elderly old women ? I’m sold !
The old woman has to be a skrull!!!
Captain marvel vs wonder woman
Marvel shouldve made a Black Widow movie as their first female lead movie. I guess that would be more hyped. I just don't feel that vibe with Capt Marvel..
Another female reboot? Well, here's another flop! Stan Lee must be spinning in his grave!!!!
So! She is basically the female version of captain America.
Okay, I personally think that this trailer was eh but wasn’t terrible just nothing “BOOMING” at me. I mean we see Samuel.L Jackson CGI’d face and a glimpse at Ronan and the skrulls. But I think they can do better then this. It’s seems too rushed I couldn’t follow and my hype meter just went down a bit. But we’ll see. Till the next trailer. And the Final product. Come on Marvel your competing against SHAZAM, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman. JUST BE ENOUGH TO HELP VENOM.
I feel like comparing it to infinity war is pointless. Infinity war was a phenomenon, with a massive crossover of mcu characters and a showdown with a powerful villain. Comparing that to a solo movie is a little unfair. I think the captain marvel trailer looks promising. Besides this is only the first trailer and the trailer doesn't exactly define the film. People are so quick to criticise because infinity war was this year so it's easy to compare them unknowingly. I'm just so happy for the first female superhero solo mcu film, that's what we should be celebrating, this is the start of many many more
The old woman is obviously a bad guy thats morphed into her
She just hit an old woman
Wonder woman is still better in my opinion
If marvel wanted an OP female hero movie shoulda done a scarlet witch one
Before everyone tries to drag her for not showing many face expressions let’s all be real and look at how many face expressions the male superheroes have. Captain America has as much expressions as Captain Marvel (so far) so don’t try to be all picky now just because she’s a woman.
Looks like a trash feminist movie. They could've at least found a better actress other than Brie Larson.. she's incredibly boring
First female marvel movie and people hate it. FOR WHY??
This is how you make a female character without trying to make her a feminist. D/C you can learn from this.
Am I the only one that thinks captain marvel looks extremely basic. I was expecting a 6’3 tone built Amazonia like woman with frost blonde hair. This just looks like they went to a miss America pageant and hired the first girl they saw.
Still waiting patiently on a Marvel movie where the main star is a Black female superhero.
Captain Marvel is my favorite woman superhero
I can actually hear feminist wetting their pants rn
They should’ve casted someone else she just doesn’t fit the female captain marvel role imo
"Please don't push a feminist agenda please don't push a feminist agenda please don't push a feminist agenda."
That's right marvel... That's how you do it cast a woman to play Carl Manvers... But you guys forgot the short hair and her face is lacking the manliness from the comics also where are her dammed peck muscles... That costume is falling off her... Listen I just read some comics she doesn't look like this okay...
The female green lantern!! Thanks a lot!
God, I hate women.
A 22 year old female with an electronic implant to control schizophrenia struck by lightning 
Looks boring to me for some reason I think wonder woman will be better then this but I'm holding off judgement until I see it looks very slow paced opposite of infinity war
Beautiful woman.
Look out Wonder Woman cause Captain Marvel  is about to beat the you lol
I love when a female hero blends right in with the males as equals. 
Wowwwwwwwwwwwww the best super women character in marvel studio. Captain marvel she gonna rock with Avengers 🤘
Yeah punch that old woman !
And they pick Captain Marvel. Talk about pleasing the feminist. 
The feminist are attacking old women. Somebody stop her! :D
Sounds like feminist propaganda to me but ok
Remember, Elektra came out about 20 years ago, so this is not a first for a female lead. Neither was Black Panther!... Remember Blade 1,2, and 3 !!
Sorry to those who were fans of the comic lol Why make captain marval a woman? its silly it wasnt written that way. Create a new super hero.
why is captain Marvel a female... hell No for me
3)For those pissed because she's a woman, get over yourself. It's been 20 movies and no solo female superhero movie yet.
Just one thing is really stupid... her nick name... Captain Marvel... WTF? Who gave to the hero that terrible name... 10y/o kid? Captain America was also, but Okay. Propaganda and the thing with cold war. Okay. But Captain Marvel? Embarrassing cliche...who will be next? Captain Bioraw for vegans and hipsters fans? Or Captain Woman for femimists or Captain Patriot Truck for all that rednecks outside?
That old woman she punched had to be a Skrull. No doubt in my mind.
1:30 She just an old woman
But most importantly she give the old woman a slapp
The Woman Green Lantern
This trailer vs. Wonder woman trailer:
Captain Marvel VS Wonder Woman
This is Marvels response to Wonder Woman...Im in!!!
Is Captain Marvel stronger than Wonder Woman?
They got black people to come out in droves for black panther... they now want women to do the same. Smh This shit look wack af
Am I the only one that’s getting a “Wonder Woman meets Green Lantern” vibe? Not that that’s a bad thing
Women Empowerment bullshit has infected Marvel now..... dull and underwhelming trailer tbh. This is not even the original Captain Marvel, smh.
A women as a superhero ?? No thanks
Don't read the comments. It's a superhero movie with a female lead. You already know what you're going to find down here.
Look  at the star on Captain Marvel's costume, then look at the star on Wonder Woman's costume from Justice League movie (2017). Simmilar? :D
-So Captain America walks in and says "you look great today ma'am." She responds with "so just because I'm a woman, you call me ma'am?!! How dare you!!!" She whips her hair back n forth and the 10000mph g force winds knocks Captain America into the next movie. Whadduya think??
Its a poor exciting trailer unlike wonder women!!
rip Wonder woman
Whole load of average looking feminist meh.
I remember her as a prettier woman.
Awesome powers and now we have a old comic man who is Captain Marvel woman! :) in this trailer if that makes a difference.
A hot and sexy actress adds a lot of things to the role ,,, eg. Black widow, Scarlet Witch, WonderWoman, Harley Quen. Their hotness and sexy looks added alot of things for making the role interesting and powerful... sometimes just their acting skills are not enough ,,,, especially in a SuperHero movie.
Upgrade for feminists
I have to admit it, she is the bravest hero. Cause.. who else is brave enough to punch an old woman?
did she just punch that old women
This discount Wonder Woman looks ok. Probably gonna watch but meh.
Eh looks boring as a drying piece of shit on a hot sidewalk, too bad all the rights to their best female super characters were held by other companies for such a long time. If I was in the lead and a woman id have argued over which suit id get to wear  because the War Bird costume is much more pleasing to look at and way more iconic than this dumpy multicolor potato sack of a flight suit shes wearing. Would it kill Brie Larson to show some emotion even that smile in the car and her glowing eyes at the end with all her energy felt like watching a dead fish.
Apparently, it reflects a counterpoint to the narrative of the Wonder Woman movie.
Looks super boring. Like a version of the show Smallville but with a female main character.
So what is this, Marvel didn't have enough imagination to create a new FEMALE hero so they had to pull out an old one and make HIM a woman? Why can't you guys leave the comic characters the way they were written and make new ones if you don't have enough women or minorities. What next? A Black Lesbian Female Thor?
She gets possessed by a Negro spirit when she punches that old white woman !!
Time to destroy Wonder Woman
Captain Marvel aka an amazing female lead. The Kree. Maybe the Secret Skrull Invasion. The 90's. I'm all in!
wonder woman is much prettier than captain marvel
At first I thought this was gonna be a horrible movie but, this trailer changed my mind. I say it's going to be just as good as Wonder Woman.
Blockbuster is bankrupt just like this feminist crap.
Wonder Woman got slammed by feminists for “unrealistic beauty standards” “sexualizing” etc and they had female only showings and whatever. Interested in seeing what controversy this and other trailers will stir :)
I just don’t picture a woman being a strong figure
Like for wonder women.
The only good thing the feminist agenda ever shat out.
so this is basically wonder woman
Finally Avengers has Superwomen❤️
Ok, a movie about a woman that hits old ladys...
My wife's daughter always dreamed about having a female superhero to relate to. Thank you, Marvel i'm so overjoyed at the prospect of my daughter watching this film that i'm literally crying
So.... it’s super woman/girl...
oh no, not another feminist movie, when will they stop, first they screwed up Star wars and now this!!!
god is a woman yall
why captain in marvel is women?
Ya'll are never happy. This movie is too 'women' for ya and Black Panther was too black. Yall only happy when it's a huge male white cast. Get over it.
Female Iron Man
Some feminists somewhere are having an orgasm ...
They pretty much doing this because they saw how well Wonder Woman did.
the feminists are gonna be crazy.
marvel not anywhere near  wonder woman
Maybe this will FINALLY shut up all the virtue signalling 3rd wave fems who complain there are no female superheroes. (Even tho there are plenty) But I doubt it.
Who knew a female would end up saving all the superheroes 😝😜🤪
But know I will go for Aquaman,Shazam and Wonder woman 84.
Spider-Woman
Why is every female superhero so overpowered
i love that captain marvel is a woman
What makes her a hero: punches an old woman for no apparent reason
movies where a female is the lead = shit
I see all these negative comments about the actor for captain marvel but I think punching an old woman and putting it on the trailer is a bad idea
Where the feminists take over
This is going to be hyped up and made out to be the best thing ever like Black Panther was just because it's a female superhero and the whole girl agender thing is being pushed massively in Hollywood at the minute but going by this disappointing trailer it's going to be another very average one from Marvel.
"i'm not what you think i am" is probably said by every white woman on earth lmao
Better than Wonder Woman❤️❤️
i like the movie but i’m just hoping they make Carol funny because the females in Marvel can’t really compare to the males when it comes to humor which is sad, and the outfit wasn’t my favorite because it’s a little tacky. i know it’s the iconic red and blue and gold but i think it would have been cuter with a red, gold, and off-white color. but i guess it’s supposed to look cool not cute lmao
+ black widow (sexy, strong and smart female) 
tbh i kinda expected more from their first trailer but still looks awesome. My favorite part is when she smacked that old woman skrull
When are we gonna get an asian women hero or that valkry girl movies!!! We are in 2018 and yet no other race has had a girl super hero and im not just talking about black people its not a black and white world. These movies are getting boring
Wonder Woman, move aside
The new « whoa look it’s a feminist movie, you go girl!» movie.
If Captain Marvel was not tied to the HUGE Marvel Cinematic Universe this Movie and this hero would just be a piss poor discount Wonder Woman
This movie is important for some. This is the second SOLID female superhero movie in the golden age of superhero movies, I know is not significative in numbers but is important to me.         (=^-ω-^=)
The strongest marvel super hero is woman 😂 wkwkwk
The new Feminist Anthem.
I really hope the movie is better than the trailer, Captain Marvel (along with SpiderWoman and Moon Knight) are one of my favorite marvel characters
Isn't this the radical feminist who specifically wanted no Man Captain Marvel in her storyline? Wont lie, this kind of screams Feminazism.
Soo this is marvel's answer for the woner woman huh
Why she slap the woman
ok...they needed a Superman in the Marvel Universe so here's the lady Superman...or Superwoman, as the case maybe
Are people hating this because it’s a female lead or are they just judging an entire movie off the trailer?
Feminist movie of the year 2019
Still DC is better than marvel,I'm talking about wonder woman😍
Listen I’m not sexist and I support women and all but Thor is badass , iron man is badass This I just don’t think so even though I’m not saying she can’t be also very boring trailer
So, let me get this straight, a feminist movie for Marvel. when the actual Captain Marvel is MALE, also Known as Billy Batson of the DC Universe, who is Also known as Shazam. Just remember CAPTAIN MARVEL is a DC Comic Character , Marvel had to steal to make up for the fact, all of the Marvel Characters suck balls.
It's time for women and blacks to rise from the ashes 😂
It’s awesome how now studious are finally making stand alone super women!
Why are people saying “not to be sexist but this movie looks boring” or “I don’t wanna watch this movie because the main character is a woman not to be sexist though” when there really being a sexist I’m a boy and I would love to watch this movie
Yo Captain Marvel, I'm really happy for you, Imma let you finish but Wonder Woman in the best superheroine of all time.
I don't know why people just don't give her a chance, you guys don't even got a real glimpse on how the movie is gonna be, how she's gonna get it done? She might not be as hot as other female actress, but there's no doubt her skills are good( Oscar Award?), I know that she considered for quite some time before decided to take on this life-changing big role, imo she valued her personal, family friends life over fame. She's not really a fan of being under limelight too much. So, why such a woman like her doesn't deserve a chance to be judged fairly? I'm pretty sure she will give out every best of herself when she was acting it, I respect her and every other actor. Btw, cap marvel is gonna be successful Marvel have gave out quite a good trailer, alot of things not revealed, that's where the fun part is😂
AWESOME, CAN'T WAIT! I'd see the whole movie just to see why she's sucker punching the old woman lol🤔
" The Future is women" says Disney, ok sure, 😑 stop with identity politics plz before you fall in the pit that Star Wars fell in.
She looks bored. Was hoping for a funny female super hero like Antman mixed with Captain America. I get that she's..... 'brainwashed'... here's hoping that she doesn't permanently stay like that.
Green Lantern woman version
That might sound dirty but she seems to be a dirty littel girl laying around in the dirt quiet often with just 3 times in this trailer. I don't think she can take on Thanos in a fair fight. Althoe why wouled Thanos fight a women...he is a true warrior...
Yeah more female superheroes! MARVEL YOU DOIN' THIS
Terrible casting with the female lead role.
2. Because its a girl (its just Marvel’s Wonder Woman) 
1:01 when your film is worse than wonder woman
Ok kids we better enjoy this before the media starts politicizing it, just like they did with Wonder Woman.
Extremely hyped for this, always had a thing for female superhero baddies like supergirl, Wonder Woman, and now captain marvel😈🔥
*punches old woman*
Eh, don't care about "chick flicks", how they copy every male superhero into some female counterpart (now or before). And then the movie companies try to cash in on that fast. Gets old very fast.
Also I’m glad that they didn’t make feminist jokes
1:30, what if the woman was Madea?
Rip Wonder Woman and her movie
oh you know feminists are gonna love this one.
Call this the Wonder woman killer
*punches old woman in the FACE* 
The future is feminist crap
Great another movie that women have taken over
This honestly looks like a Pre-Wonder Woman DCEU movie.... ouch.
Wonder Woman who?
Carol Danvers: the only superhero who could slap an old woman in a train and get away with it
When she slap the old woman i laughed so hard
The first female Captain Marvel was Monica Rambeau technically, its kinda complicated. If they won't make a Storm solo film, please do a Monica Rambeau solo film, & acknowledge  in the story she was the first "captain marvel" (which they probably won't).  Wait so, in the comics Monica Rambeau is the first female "captain marvel", but in the movie they are making her unborn when Carol Danvers is on earth. So the MCU is making Monica the second female captain marvel in the films? WHAT?
What makes a hero? Smack an old woman in public. LOL WTF
Wait did yall see she hit an old woman right?
Feminists where y'all at
The old woman is a skrull
Of course feminist Brie Larson and her Mary Sue Captain Marvel arrives to save us all from Thanos.
I hope they dont treat her as a female hero and just treat her like a hero its honestly better for everyone
Feminist women claim youth doesn’t matter 
Is she gonna have the same facial expression the entire film? Wonderwoman blows this film out the water. Marvel comics and films are done cuz of pc culture.
I know the hell she just slapped an old woman...Thanos beat her ass
Wonder Woman fans are so threatened by Captain Marvel, it's insane.
Finally a marvel Female protagonist movie!
More like feminist part of marvel
Feel like they need a woman with an edgier look. 
Finally a Marvel movie about lead female superhero. Now Black Widow will have her time to shine.
THAT trailer gives me...i don't know maybe BORED...!? I mean I was expecting something more of a woman who is going to defeat Thanos (badass like Scarlet Witch or cool like Black Widow) but this girl ain't giving any feeling, HER EXPRESSION is flat and doesn't give anything to make people feel like Thanos should be scared of her??? Nah, I don't think this gonna work this time. Sorry Marvel, I'm bit disappointed
Lol, feminist are gonna talk ALOT about this movie
No way captain marvel outsells Wonder Woman
Still wonder woman.
1% change i will be the only kid commenting also thats why block buster went out of bunis a woman crash threw a roof
Another feminist propaganda film sold by Disney just like Zootopia, Beauty and the Beast 2017, and Star Wars.
1:30 hitting old women I liked it! :D
God is a woman and her name is captain marvel
I will not support misandrist Brie Larson. Feminists prove once again that feminism is about women's supremacy and misandry.
It’s like the twillight meme all over again, female actor with only one face expression
-Feminist agenda pushing writers at Marvel.
Better than dc's wonder woman!!!!!!
Okkkkk so don't get me wrong. I love Brie, i ADORE marvel, i luuuuv me some superhero movies and i'm all for another female in this role. However, i found this trailer really boring, so she's like superman 2.0? Idk man
But will Captain Marvel be better than Wonder Woman?
I like it ! Need some more bad ass women in the MCU !
Setting a new standard. Men will forever be the hapless unwitting failures and women will have better upper body strength... according to Hollywood.
here we go with the feminist garbage.... smfh... "she's going to be stronger than Thor" really... gtfo...
I’ll be the sexist-badguy.  An overpowered female hero is just not cool.
I love marvel... but this trailer was kind of shit. Also I have zero problem with a female lead, but I really dislike this actress.
Captain Lesbo Feminist Marvel
Brie Larson is one of the most beautiful superheroes out there besides wonder woman
Female. Superhero. Double fail
Why she punched that old woman ?😝🤒
why is there the need to do a female version for everything!! Look what they did to Star Wars, terrible !!
I’m sick of seeing the ‘feminist invasion’ comments here. How is this a toxic feminist agenda? Yeah, a woman has her own movie on her own. WHOAAAA how absolutely UNTHINKABLE. Grow up, manchildren.
I'm freaking excited about the first female marvel movie
It looks good so far. Wasn’t on board with Disney changing a character for socio-political reasons but she seems to not be that bad at all (still think the change was uncalled for but objectively she probably won’t do that bad, hopefully). Just saying it might be dragged down a bit by the whole, ‘we HAVE to put women over men because the world might implode with injustice otherwise,’ idea. But so far the movie looks like it might be good, she looks good, Samuel Jackson looks pulp fictionary (which is to say he looks good). Super excited.
Superhero movies are better and more entertaining when lead actors are men. This looks really forced and cringy just like wonder woman. Sorry.
So she's superman and wonderwoman combined but better
This looks totally bad ass. Brie Larson looks just like Captain Marvel! I have a feeling this is yet another break through flick from Marvel on par with DC's Wonder Woman.
What makes a hero. Idk. But it's not a woman
Life to give a fc about something as hard as captain marvel but it’s just not happening. Not even an ounce of excitement for this character especially when studio executives are over powering her and cramming her down our throats just to compete with the success of Wonder Woman. Iron man or Thor deserve to kill shot on Thanos so much more.
Not to sound like a feminist but this looks good 😍
I’d rather see the second Wonder Woman movie 🍿
Overrated trying be like Wonder Woman woman woman gawd
Still it’s not bad, it just looks like it will fall into that vein of “we need a stronger hero, so let’s just throw her in the mix.” That with this whole feminist movement behind the film is a real turn-off. I personally can’t stand that shes rubbing it in that we need a female super hero in Marvel when they’ve had three really awesome female characters that they’ve been ignoring for years. Let them have the spotlight for once. I want my Natasha or Wanda movie already
I hate female lead super heroes
Better hope for feminist support, I feel a bomb coming.
I swear to god if someone ruins this by making it all about women....why can't we just have heroes be heroes without making such a big deal out of their gender?
Can you people just accept her as a hero? Female this, female that. Stop focusing on her damn gender and starting focusing in her character. I don’t know why you feel the need to treat her any different. If it was a male superhero you wouldn’t mention a single thing about his gender.
Marvel Fans need to pick it up a notch, Wonder Woman's first trailer was the most view in 24 hours when it came out and still sets the top 3 viewed trailers in 24 hours. This movie looks as awesome as Wonder Woman, I hope marvel fan boys small mentility does not doom this movie at the box office.
she's going to kill thanos with a fake feminist allegation
Seeing her punch that Old Woman can only mean one thing..... Skrulls Baby!!
Yeah.... ride those Wonder Woman coat tails Marvel....
Lol i see a lot of guys here hating this because it's a female Superhero movie..i'm a guy and i like this, so stop bringing your hate and just enjoy the trailer ..what is wrong with a female Superhero??is in the Comic and it's not like they just bring out from nowhere...and for those who complain about the cgi..this is just the first trailer not the actual movie so stop complaining..
Wonder Women :::: space version
That old woman was a Skrull but most people won’t guess that. Placing that scene right after calling Captain Marvel a hero was blatantly retarded.
Marvel's Wonder Women
Brie Larson you are my hero!! I'm very proud and happy, you represent strong women.
Looks awesome. However, she better be a real character. Not just not static, she should have character flaws too, like any other good character. Strong females? Great. Perfect females? please don't.
Captain Marvel > Wonder Woman
Looks better than Wonder Woman.
Wonder women is that you?
Looks crap, this woman can't act or maybe she didn't get the character right, this looks very haphazardly put together like a movie being made just for the sake of it. I hope I'm wrong though.
Sinister six is gonna have a female leader.
yay superman ..sorry woman or is it power rangers?
As long as there's no feminist man bashing nonsense going on with the character, it's all good. Marvel hasn't let us down yet, so hopefully they won't go that direction, unlike Crapleen Kennedy over at Lucasfilm.
Captain Marvel vs Wonder Women
Not interested in this at all. She has no screen presence what so ever. I think that she probably only appeals to dykes and hard core feminists.
The best thing from this trailer is how it reeks of mutant introduction since Rogue stole Captain Marvel's Powers and also gave her amnesia.  The worst thing from this trailer is how it has to push that this is a woman.  It would be as irrelevant as advertising that Steve Rogers is a man.
Wonder Woman: I am the greatest female hero on the big screen.
The cast showing Jude law as captain marvel but the trailer showing a woman playing a super hero. Im comfuse.
whoever made this character thank you, for giving more space to women and more choices for girls to choose what super hero costume they look for in haloween. Because hell we dont have as many as the boys.
Another movie with a strong female character. Love brie larson!
What do you want to be for Halloween sweet daughter? CAPTAIN MARVEL!...now let's ride the subway so I can punch an old woman
women are strong hahahahahaha
marvels feminist movie is here. step a aside wonder woman this is how you do it.
The First Marvel Movie where the Main Character is a Female
Woman of one face expression
I hate female super heroes
Also did we need it to go from "her" to "a hero"? Because it's getting tiring seeing trailers that star women as the lead having the fact they're female be paraded. I don't care she has boobs, I'm here to see action and a story.
im not sexist or anything and im not really into marvel but why is a woman playing this character? is it supposed to be a woman?
This is the coolest thing to ever happen. Ariana we now have proof god is a woman.... Brie Larson
This movie looks lame. Theatre will be full of feminists
Seriously, I thought this was going to be a fun movie. Why does it look like it is from DC? Are they trying to rip off Wonder Woman?
Captain Marvel >>> Wonder Woman
Did she actually just punched an old woman? 😂
That old woman gave her a flashback that she *really* didn't like.
Just don't suck. The casting of Brie already had me worried, but hopefully the movie is overall good and isn't the MCU's first commercial failure of a movie. And making her the most powerful hero thus far in the MCU also concerning as she isn't near to being the most powerful in the comics. As long as this isn't some feminist/over powered female character trope, we'll be fine.
1:27 can’t just have a female led film without “in your face” feminist messages
So when did Captain Marvel became a women.
A woman... Really?
Wonderwoman> Superman de Marvel 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sorry, but casting Wonder woman is a hundred times better!
1:31 is that being a hero? Hitting an elder? I feel sad for the old woman...
I don't know why. But that part where she slapped the crap of the old woman made was funny as hell.
Is this Wonder Woman?
Garbage! if they make her better than everyone else just becuse of some feminist shit they will loooose a lot of money and views btw begone thots
she is no wonder woman thats for sure
Wonder Womans overrated ass can move aside
Not another female super hero movie 👎🏾
As much as I love women superhero movies (there isn't a lot of them), but I wouldn't watch this movie. It just seems so bland and well boring.
Bye bye wonder woman .
10% of "blablabla female hero = propaganda blablabla"
Why did she punch the old woman😢?
I liked Wonder Woman because I wanted to nail her. This broad does nothing for me and I think she has a few pounds to lose. I already have my Marvel Studios heroes I don't need a chubby chick with anger issues.
She punched the shit out that old woman....😂😂😂😂😂was NOT expecting that
sorry but wonder woman looks way better
For halloween ghosts say tales about feminists.
So what? Is she like the leader of the Avengers or some shit? She just looks like Superwomen to me
Better than Wonder woman?
Let the comparisons with Wonder Woman begin...
Marvel Studios let DC put out an overhyped female lead movie first, and let everyone falsely claim it was a good movie for female empowerment. And then they decided to put out an actual great movie. All I'm saying is that Wonder Woman was a horrible movie and this is gonna be fantastic.
Wonder Woman trailer is better than this. Even Shazam trailer is better. Hopefully you make better trailer for next full trailer
Why did she punch the old woman my heart broke when she do it 💔
Illegal Alien attacks an elderly woman.
Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, please STEP UP because Avengers will be headed by a woman. Her name is CAPTAIN MARVEL
so yep,basically a rip off of Wonder Woman
These marvel studio are taken to highs by Iron Man Robert Downey Jr. and team and now suddenly one women comes and lead them all. Damn you makers, feminism is killing society, life, family and now even movies. Equality should be in terms of quality and effort used not just eating the cherry from top of cake. Wont watch these movies and see how they earn money. Boycott marvel movies and if not Iron Man than no watch of marvel studios anymore. IRON MAN DESERVES TO BE LEADER NOT OPPORTUNISTIC FEMINISM.
She punched that old woman 😂😂😂
About time Marvel has a female lead a movie - I know Ant Man and the Wasp was the  first step in a co-lead, but truly glad that DC/WB's Wonder Woman success got Marvel to thinking about making a story about a female hero - and literally stand on her own.
Yes, we care about the story, the content of the movie and the character by itself *as much as* we care about the fact the MC is a woman (and not only the fact the MC is a woman, but mainly how she's being portrayed).
A very poor Trailer, expected better. Marvel trying to ride the DC bandwagon and trying to copy their success with Wonder Woman. Sorry going to be a flop.
Why she punched the old woman? 😲
Captain marvel is woman? WTF at least not black
Guarantee this is better than wonder woman.
looks heros of all marvel are beaten 1 damn women. and she's captain. waiting 4 releasé at march. nick fury is looks good with 2 eyes,  remembering pulp fuction.  Captan Marcel ser youcut AT cinema .
She's gonna be the first female lead and solo film in the MCU
So this is marvel's Mary Sue who's gonna fly in a defeat Thanos and emasculate all the men for the entertainment of everyone? The way Disney has been poorly shoving strong women into movies has been so condescending towards women, I now laugh at any strong women in media. Also, her costume has always been bland and boring.
Old Woman With a Skrull 😈🕑
EVERYONE: oh this trailer so the movie is going to be boring as well. It's not going to be better than wonder woman.
Edit: I’m not saying wonderwoman focused on the lead being a women I’m talking about how the audience reacted and gave it extra points for having a woman In it. At least that’s what I’ve seen
And the main character is a woman? 
at 1:30  did she just punched an old woman !?
wow ! Captain woman ? xD
y'all who say the casting isn't good or that brie can't act: 1) she has an oscar so she's already acting a ton better than y'alls faves, 2) how did you expect her to act when she's just walking? what kinda emotional expression should she have??? especially when it seems like she's lost her memories?? it's only the first trailer and you guys are judging based on that. you only care about pitting her against wonder woman or any other mcu film. the least you could do was keep your judgment on hold for when the actual movie comes out because judging based on a two minute trailer that's meant to not reveal much and only give us the first look of the character is extremely pathetic. get a job.
why does everytime  i watched the trailer everyone diss it? for me, its a movie of a strong marvel heroine that we all adore and idolized. hahaha I cant disliked this one haha carol danvers like a lit woman in the mcu; however if Nova is in it damn!
Es la segunda parte de Wonder Woman :v!?
Anyone feel it was unfair that Scarjo is not the first one to have a marvel movie with a woman leading the film? She may not even get her own movie right?
I love how she right hooked that old woman so hard
It's like superwoman, but a bit older and lame. Sigh..
Wonder Woman
Wonder women, who dat? Captain marvel is here!!
The fact this is released on International Women's Day gives me life
Oh a new marvel hero..*punch a older woman in the face* ohhh .. ok
Does she have in her contract not to smile strong women don't smile I guess
Dude wtf captain marvel's a woman
I bet the old woman was a fake
I don't like female in most powerful character.. It looks like comedy
The Feminists Are Taking Over
Rip wonder women 😂
A woman version of superman
Seems good. Hopefully they don’t infiltrate it with a women right movement. I’m just trying watch a movie.
honestly it looks ok, but i'm gonna see it just because i have not seen a female led superhero movie in theaters
The start of MCU feminist era.
This will smash records of "Wonder Women".
Awesome trailer 🖖🖖🖖🖖 captain marvel best trailer in women Marvel's 😍😍😍😍😍
A+ for the visual of Brie Larson clocking an elderly woman in the face.
In a world where old women believe they can sit on any seat they want, one woman will show them that they can't! Introducing Captain Marvel...all will fall, and they will not get up.
This just looks like man of steel female edition.
This woman can
*"Evacuate the city, engage all defenses and get this old woman a shield"*
It only took them 20 movies to make one with a female lead *slow clap*
Kind of disappointing trailer . After infinity war this looks crap. Wonder woman was also better than this.😅
Wonder woman > Captain Marvel
You know who else I think is a Skrull? The woman who told Tony about Charles Spencer in civil war. Cuz she got a bigger role in MCU as Black Mariah in Luke Cage. The police officer  in The Avengers final battle scene. Cuz he got a bigger role on Agent Carter. The army officer in The Incredible Hulk. Cuz he got a bigger role of Remorath leader in Agents of SHIELD season 5
*Maybe Wonderwoman set a high standard for a woman superhero.* that's why a lot from here were not buying the trailer.
Aquaman movie looks good. Your move DCEU!!! I would pick Capatin Marvel over wonder woman any day!!!
Farhad Arian is a weak feminist troll typing nonsense about misogyny.
So a white woman is gonna save the universe. Great.
SHE punched a women is SHE a villan
Are we FINALLY having a transwoman as a hero in a superhero movie??? It's about damn time.
Feminists unite!!
Old lady : still wonder woman you mug 1:30
May be bcoz not matter how powerful is a male character, he always want woman while a powerful female character dont need man.
I feel so bad saying this...but she makes wonder woman look good 😐
From “her” to “a hero”... the future truly is female
1:31 Respect ELDER women
She's kinda like Wonder Woman.....
"shes an empowered women and we need to showcase women in leader roles more!"
Is anybody else getting a serious Wonder Woman vibe cause I am
I hope this doesn't have the Black Panther/Wonder Woman effect. This movie looks good but I hope people dont heavily overrate it.
I hope this movie isn't going to be feminist propaganda. Just give us a movie everyone can enjoy.
R.I.P Wonder Woman
keep in mind this is Marvel’s 21st movie, Wonder Woman was DC’s 4th
A woman to save the rest of the marvel heros?
That's not an old woman!
I hope this is good, please don't be like Black Panther, please don't be boring. Be more like Wonder Woman if possible.
First time that I see a blonde punch a granny woman
Thor/Hulk is the strongest Avenger.  They are hyping up Carol because she's a women.
My grandpa died today and this trailer was the best thing that happened to me today. I can’t believe that this is getting so much hate. It’s the first trailer, it’s supposed to have something missing. Also, Brie is an amazing actress and Marvel makes amazing movies (there are, of course, some exceptions-but those were years ago.) You can’t judge a book by its cover. Also: the most upsetting hate is the one on how feminist this movie is going to be. IT HAS A FRICKING FEMALE LEAD!!!! People are saying it’s going to be bad and will be praised by the media ONLY because there’s a female lead. This is a huge step for women. Wonder Woman was, so why can’t Captain Marvel be? It’s a shame that people are voicing their opinions on this with negativity and hate towards this and everyone involved with it.
Feels like Wonder Woman to me..
I'm not one of these fools who will assume that you're sexist if you didn't like the trailer. If you didn't, you didn't. Meanwhile, I thought it was okay. And while I wish they would stop treating people like idiots by assuming we don't know this is a woman instead of a man, I do like the transition in the trailer from "her" to "a hero".
I don’t care if this pisses off feminists I actually hope it does but this looks like a shit film just to make marvel not look sexist
Did Captain Marvel just punch an old woman in the face?
Feminists they going to act like they knew Captain Marvel before the trailer...
THIS is how a female superhero would dress
In a nutshell... literally female Thor that aims for the head
*Feminists Are On The Way*
We know that old woman was a Skrull she was punching.. but we also know it was put there for the "down with the old" agenda.
So, Superwoman?
Well, I loved Wonder Woman in Batman v Superman. But I didn't expect a lot of her movie because of the trailer but when I watched it I really loved it. I hope to get a surprise again, 'cause this trailer isn't as exciting as I expected.
Another woman character smh
This definitely looks like a pass. Captain Marvel being a female ruins it. Sorry, not going to watch.
This commercial is gonna get controversial, but only because she punched an Old Woman without explaining her being a Skrull 😂
You're right. I thought you were a superhero, but it turns out you're just a woman who viciously assaults sweet old ladies.
Ew women belong in the kitchen
Of course it’s a woman!
She is mōre or lêss like the female version of Thor......& secondly the music reminds me of some old vìdeo gãme music
Yeah.....f*ck Wonder Woman. This actually looks awesome.
I hope the full movie isnt a bunch of feminist crap
ANNNNDDD .. Captain Marvel is a women. I get that we need "gender equality" , but to completely make a dude bad ass character now female is abit to political for my taste.. thanks marvel :( ... does that bother anyone else??
she must be autistic being from an advanced civilization looks so lost in primitive world like earth... trailer looks generic and boring af... like a 100500 de ja vu is this a remake of green lantern with a female... a fighter pilot space... boring
Although this trailer wasn't all that I can tell I will enjoy it more than Wonder Woman.
4. Old woman probably rooted for Wonder Woman. She got what she deserved.
*immediately punches an old woman in her face*
So it comes out on Mar 8 AKA International Women's Day
Rip Wonder Woman
In the comics, Captain Marvel was a man, until it got passed to a girl. I think his wife? So no, not a feminist hero. Just going along with a particular story.
This looks more like a Nick Fury and Coulson movie than a Captain Marvel movie. How is it that Samuel L. Jackson has more dialog and authoritative scenes than her? And why they would call this Captain Marvel and not "Marvel Girl" is beyond idiotic. Just like "The Force Within" used the black guy Storm Trooper scenes to start a buzz over the movie (even creating false rumors of him being a Storm Trooper-turn-Jedi from the scene and promos of him holding a lightsaber), Just as Mad Max: Fury Road was hyped around Tom Hardy playing Mel Gibson's role, Samuel L Jackson is the main force behind this movie (possibly the resurgence of SHEILD) behind this movie. But as we all know, The Force Awaken and Fury Road were nothing more than feminist finger bangers throwing a hissy fit at "representation" when they are the ones who don't want to risk ANYTHING to put ANYTHING OUT. Instead, they want a blank check like a gold digger, yet claim to be grassroots/independent.
I know it's kinda trivial but I wish her voice were less girlish and a little more lower-pitched to help make her character more convincing, you know, the way Gal Gadot sounds as Wonder Woman, but without the accent LOL.
I thought female super heroes had to wear skirts....
So excited for another high-profile badass woman for little girls to look up to. It's not a solution, it's not perfect, but it's better than what we've had.
them 43k dislikes are Wonder Woman and the Amazonian soldiers
Wonder Woman ain't shit! Team Marvel forever!!!
So Captain Marvel punches a woman on the bus and is called a superhero, yet when I do it, suddenly there's a problem...
Looks like Shitty and cheap wonder woman 🤣🤣.
Gal Gadot wasn't a very good actress,  at all.  She was mediocre,  at best during her previous performance in BvS. Her acting rept before that wasn't much either. Don't get me wrong, i love her, and i liked wonder woman. But she isn't a very versatile actress. Gorgeous, no doubt.  Despite that,  i barely saw any guys commenting on the fact that she looks stiff or that her acting is boring.  
She Hit That Old Woman Like Detroit Ho Owing Money To Mississippi Pimp
She just socks that old woman hahahah
Poor Wonder woman is gonna loose all her thunder.
Didn't watch any good movies in last few years. I'm done with Hollywood feminism. I respect women and believe they should get equal opportunities everywhere but F me with female hero movies. Only female hero for me is my Mom.
Believe it or not, young heterosexual, masculine boys can look up to, and want to be like awesome powerful female heroes too.  Brie Larson's Captain Marvel looks like it's going to be on that level.
Wonder Woman & Marvel Captain
"A hero" proceeds to slap a old woman
One of the most powerful female superhero movie releasing on International Women's Day. Nice move Marvel.
Do skrulls mean we're having spider-woman coming too? (She's also Captain Marvel's bff)
I'm still putting my bets on Wonder Woman rather than captain marvel in a 1 on 1 fight.
She just punch old woman? Okey..
What wee need? Female superhero,people will get insane.
female green lantern
this trailer was shit it didn't hype me as much but i hope the movie is good especially cause it is MCU first female led superhero movie if that comes out well it will be a game changer for marvel. So marvel please make the next trailer good!
Stll Wonder women is best.😂😂😂😂
Wonder Woman: Marvel Edition
Wonder woman sounds like a warrior this one sound like my lil sis that "can't even"
My favourite part is when she punched the old woman.
Captain Marvel already has more character complexity than wonder woman in the span of 2 minutes.
isnt this woman suppose the others
1:30 are you wonder woman?
Marvel: "Female Super hero's aren't profitable."
I wonder if this is gonna be like another Female ghostbusters or Oceans 8 kinda flop?
I watch this several times and I find it more boring that woman cannot emote she has one tone and it sounds like she's bored and I bet the movies going to make her overpowered with no flaws to appease the feminist this is wait till Netflix movie you don't need to see this in the theater
Wonder Woman > Captain Marvel. Only Marvel fanboys will disagree.
It's clear from the triler that he's a fantastic film and better than Wonder Woman followed DC
*Feminists joined the game*
I guess this builds up for Captain Marvel vs Wonder woman
expecting tough competition against wonderwoman (galgadot)
Captain marvel or Wonder woman
The Aquaman trailer basically had special effects. Where was Mamoa's performance? He gets emotional? Why did not anyone complain about his acting? Funny the hysteria that grew in relation to Larson's performance. I could swear that boys really are bothered with a woman with prominent role in MCU.
This trailer was just.. meh.  And those who say that people dislike it because it's a superhero movie with a female lead are the real sexist ones. 
A Female Superman in the MCU im on board huge Superman fan BTW
1:30 *_How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old woman?_*
I can't wait to see costumes during Halloween. All the wonder woman costumes will be extinct. Lol
**smacks tf outta a smiling 90 year old woman**
She’s a sting independent woman. But can she pass a pt test?
tbh I'm not as hyped after seeing the trailer, I realized that it's just gonna be a female superman and it bored me, and I guess I never realized that when I read the comics or saw the teaser in infinity war
I'm sure this would be 100 times better than overrated Wonder Woman movie.
Eat Your Heart Out Wonder Woman
the first woman stay alone superhero movie of marvel and maybe strongest character of marvel
If I can watch Iron Man 2 & 3, Thor 1 & 2, I can watch this. Marvel usually does a good job and lately they have been spot on. I hope they can bring as good a story for their female lead as DC did with Wonder Woman.
For the love of all things good, please let this trailer be no indication of how amazing the movie will (hopefully) actually be. I remember watching the Black Panther trailer for the first time and being hyped for days, but this was so generic and bland. The first female fronted Marvel movie should have had a trailer that matched the level of anticipation.
*Oh boi the feminists stepped up their game*
This looks liek women in black capeshit edition
Now go beat thanos woman
Finally, me and my cousin are so excited for the first Marvel movie with a female in the title.
Marvels Wonder woman
Lastly, props to punching an Elderly woman! They knew putting that in the trailer would start us talking! WooHoo!
As long as I dont have to ask her about her feminist agenda
UltraWoman 2019 March
Why punch old woman?
Not the greatest trailer but seems interesting but I hope no one starts hating on it because she’s a women
She then proceeds to punch an elderly woman in the face.
Captain Marvel? Oh, you mean BETTER Wonderwoman???
Why she slap the old woman
Until now i cant relate. Why must her becoming the captain marvel? Why not anyone else. I freaking dont like her. I think there are better female outhere can be captain marvel. Arghhhh.
She punched the shit out of that old woman 😂😂
I just can't cope with the idea of a strong woman, this movie is confusing.
Ladies & gentlemen,i present to you the female Marvel version of Hal Jordan aka Green Lantern & Clark Kent aka Superman.
*slaps an old woman*
We had people who said Robert Downey Jr and gal Gadot were insignificant for the roles of iron man n wonder woman.. but now look where the world is with them today. Yeah, she might look a bit grumpy but that's how her character is.. And why is it hard to believe that she can be the strongest avenger? I think people are mostly disappointed because Nick fury called a 'woman' to help.. These people would have been much happier if other beings like silver surfer or oh yeah Obi wan Kenobi were being called to save the day!
Captain Marvel to Wonder Woman : I hope they remember you
Best part of this trailer is punching an old woman in the face
I mean not the best marvel trailer, but it was ok. Nothing to exciting. Pretty cringy when they did what makes “her” then transition it to “a hero”. Just to state the fact that it’s marvels first female lead movie. The pictures got me more hyped then the trailer sadly. I just hope we get a more exciting trailer in 2019.
women can rise a children
Man hating hypocritical feminist Brie Larson will benefit from a franchise built mainly by male characters.
Warner brothers: We have Wonder woman 
I have never been so excited to see another female superhero movie since Wonder Woman. May I mention that I can’t wait for Wonder Woman 84!
If a newcomer takes down thanos then marvel can suck my balls, disney trying to push there feminist shit on marvel like they did with star wars.
Future is female
I Don't Know If Its Me Or That Marvel Made A Movie About A Woman SuperHero For The First Time .
Feminists are on their way
She kinda like Wonder Woman+Supergirl
Why she hits Old woman? 1:29
RIP wonder Woman
Captains are Men....why is she female
me: captain marvel will give us so many important links, a whole new female superhero AND a Fury backstory.
First ever Solo Film for a woman superhero in the MCU... I think
Is this another feminist film ? Women super heroes are just not appealing sorry not sorry
My main issue is that Carol Danvers is the 'last' Captain Marvel in a long line of others who carried the Captain Marvel name both male and female but the green suit she wears at the beginning pretty much means all of those other Captain Marvels have been erased.
If they put feminist jokes in there I'm leaving
The wonder woman of marvel
if you want Hollywood to accept a strong female character, make sure you look like a guy. Come on guys,  she's seems good, but can't they put a more feminine chic, she got more manly features than I do LOL.
I GOT CHILLS MAN! So psyched for Marvel's first female superhero movie lead ♥♥♥
1:30 Bloody Old Women
at 1:29 we finaly  see the skrulls, so i guess that woman she hits is a skrull. and yeah captain marvel is on hulk and thor's levell. and the first captain mar-vel was thanos' nemesis till mar-vel died of cancer. After thanos'return from death it became adam warlock. but why is it so bad that it's the newest captain marvel, she became superpowered by being exposed to his kree power annyway. and when she was binary  she was waayyy more powerfull so what's the big deal?
Captain Marvel Vs. Wonder Woman
feminist version of superman?
women can wkwkwkwk,,,,
Let's just hope this movie won't be too political. That always ruins female superhero films.
*Old woman: Where is your butt??
I’m confused now, growing up captain marvel was the guy who yelled Shazam, now captain marvel is a woman but the guy yelling Shazam has changed his name to Shazam and still exists?!?!?!?
Why is captain marvel a woman the feminist are taking over it 
Conservatives will start whining and bitching about feminist as usual.
More shite from Marvel. Please stop. Strong females trying to be like men, it doesn't work. Try something original. Ripley from Aliens....great character
I'm not what you think I am: What a feminist victim catch phrase
Female saktiman😂
No questions no answers *wonder woman , captain marvel and Ms marvel* are the most powerful females of all time.....
This movie is gonna kick Wonder Woman’s butt
Once again feminists ruin cinema by pushing for a female green lantern remake
Me: A woman with no respect for the elderly? You just proved that a few seconds ago.
so... basically its Super Woman... ive seen this before
This looks like the cheapest worst movie from the mcu yet. No it doesn't matter that she's a women, I liked Wonder Woman so don't even start with me on some sexist shit this just looks bad.
It’s a well dressed Wonder Woman
I hope the movie is better than it looks right now in this preview... they always pick women who don't look physically capable... Or they just don't look strong at all. I just wish that sometimes when they pick an actor to play a female superhero that she actually looks like a badass... She actually looks strong. That would be nice. Hopefully the movie is good.
And not to compare but I thought Wonder Woman was great and the best DCEU film but this will be better!!
Im all for female superheroes, but idk if i like "captain marvel". Im not really getting like excited. Maybes its her backstory or something idk.
Wow, the power of woman! Don't ever treat it with levity.
u see THATS what i want, not making captain america female orany other char but having an OWN STRONG female character ..
looks boring.. i m not convinced a pretty face can be the most powerful avenger.. more powerful than hulk? another feminist misadventure its going to be.. too bad for marvel..
This looks pretty good. But I hope people  don’t only focus on the fact that the lead is a women. Focus on the movie first
Worse than wonder woman
This movie is racist and sexist for having a white female protagonist.
Oh boy i can't wait to hear all the feminist bullshit about this movie
I really want this movie to do well. But the way they cut the trailer made this movie look boring and conventional. Come on! It's the first Marvel female lead with her own movie on the big screen. Make our jaws drop!
Incoming angry feminists' comments insulting the dumb comments about this being feminist propaganda. 
I don't like female heroes.
All the women, who are independent...
Seeing Captain Marvel punch an old woman who was smiling at her without context was hilarious. 
Woah! First sorry that I've watched this now! WTF was I doing before! Really lookin forward to Female Superhero Movie that too from Marvel! Obviously it's gonna be a Damnshit Flick.
Going to be crap compared to WonderWoman
Marvel's Superwoman 😂
So.. A true hero is made by punching old womans? Lol
I'm not really a fan of this character .. I mean I don't have a problem with a women superheroes (I love wonder-women) 
Too much feminists propaganda in this movie.. Hope it fails.
*Captain Marvel punches an old woman*
I like to think they put discover what makes "Her" a hero since the fact that is an ever-expanding Universe over a span of ten years with many characters with their own hero traits and story so we get to see Her hero story, and that they not just promoting the first Marvel female movie
Seems like a feminist Green Lantern rip off
Punching an old woman, worst avenger ever xD
I hate women characters.
This looks a little boring to me, like the same marvel movie over and over, no innovationat all, the only thing that i see different its a women lead, thats it, i hope they make it better in the next trailer
The future is Woman
This is gonna be a better wonder woman
That punch to the face of that old woman was awesome 😂
Brie Larsson punches old women confirmed.
tapi klo cantiknya seperti wonder women , mantep :D
Im talking about the feminists in real life not the main character in the movie (im not making it feministic)
[continued]  Aiming square for women, who have been hurt ~ 1:40 - 1:42 ... Very young Carol, young Carol, Air Force Carol ... They all are GETTING UP. .. Rising.  This movie is going to slay women.
Hmmm a female fighter pilot and her copilot is female as well.🤔 pushing the women power much are we. Female pilots are not common but there are those badass women out there but to have two in one squadron and to be her copilot, cmon Marvel. I dig women characters but bitch please.
When you just realized that this is the first Marvel movie stand alone starring a female superhero 
R.I.P wonder woman 😂🤣
had to get a woman to kill thanos smh
Feminists are taking over 😂
Wait, as there a seen where that girl hit an old woman? Wonder if that makes in the movie
1:30 When you trick or treat and the old woman gives you an apple.
Don't call me misogynist but I m missing feminine element, bcoz hero is a women.
However, it must be said that it has very little to do with the women themselves, and more with the 2018 political agenda narrative that seems to grow exponentially whenever theres a woman on screen.
To people who think this doesn’t feel like Marvel, or seems off, I’d just like to bring up a point or two. This is Marvel’s first female hero movie. Forgetting agendas and whatnot, that’s the truth. It’s gonna be a little different. But until we actually see the film, let’s try not to judge it.
Shoutout to all the feminists this ones for you
Wonder Woman looked way more exciting
the question is will the movie be better than wonder women
***Alltogether now.......MEHHHHH yawn!! Marvel and DC just hv to one up each other. With the Success of WW Marvel feels they need a female hero lead. With the success of Black Panthers Kilmonger DC made Aquamans villain Black Mantis..lol Deathstroke DC= Deadpool Marvel.....Superman DC=Sentry Marvel and so on....I dont think it will suck..but I just dont think it made sense to go back in time and go the way of Captain Marvel the female version...her face looks so bland....HOWEVER..if they zip to the future towards the end of the movie to tie in to current Avengers....which they will as evident of the( beeper drop) at the end of Infinity....THAT WILL BE COOL....for 45 seconds...lol
wander women was 1000 times better than this and I haven't even seen this movie yet
Wonder Woman but blonde
My name is Captain Marvel... I am an Earthling and an Avenger. But today I stand as one with the settlers of Torfa, who claim this planet and its resources as they were freely given in the aftermath of the Behemoth disaster... They are a peaceful people, but I am a woman of war. If you move against them, you move against me. I am willing to die here today, for this cause. I have made my choice... Now you make yours.
Hollywood: Guys! Let's remake every movie, but with "a strong female lead"
Am I the only one who feels like this is going to be obnoxiously dull, unentertaining and a negative review film compared to wonder woman. Marvel need to step up their game
Should do more female marvel characters
This trailer really isn’t very good, nothing about it gets me exited to see the movie in any way like Wonder Woman’s trailer did.
This is the HERo we need. Someone who's not afraid to deck old ladies right in the jaw. My God this looks exponentially better than Wonder Woman.  And best of all: No trailer for the trailer!!!!
@1:30 well she just punch an old woman, that made me laugh.
And honestly Captain Marvel doesn't have to be a character pushing a feminist agenda, if they don't make her character a political thing, then I could possibly like her, but of course as I said, I'm not getting my hopes up.
One of this female Captain Marvel's alternative names was Binary. 
A bit weird that they say Captain Marvel and its a woman. Like couldn't they have made it like Ms.Marvel?
No matter how hard the feminists can try, the super heroes stuff only suits the Male characters.
RIP Blockbuster and that old woman face.
Seems to me all the people who are complaining are basicly saying "smile more honey". Then they say no I am not a misoginist cause I like Wonder Woman but in that trailer the "funny" parts in between the action was her being a cute, confused fish out of water and smiling in wonder at ice cream. So yeah. Also did you know asking a women to smile will get you sent to the Bad Place. In conclusion Joker to Batman "why so serious" fanboys "wooohoo!!!"
Wonder women trailer it self super😇
Captain Marvel vs Wonder Woman?
3. Actually make her HEROIC and have a character arc. Have her put the lives of others before herself. Have her make rookie mistakes and lose early on and learn from them. It just involves tweaking a few scenes, not rewriting the script. The ONE thing the DCEU did right was _Wonder Woman._ Don't have this movie be the one thing the MCU does _wrong._
Grandma: Are you wonder woman?
It's Compare excited like Wonder Woman Trailer this 2019 as Her became Her_o
Wonder Woman is much hotter than this lady.
Is this just female Superman?
I bet they made captain Marvel a woman bc of those feminists lol
Step aside Wonder Woman and the 13th Doctor.
My first note @39 seconds, Marvel's not in the room, or at least the business dressed woman doesn't seem to be captain Marvel, and that looks like our hydra scientist, is that a RPG in nicks hands? That must be the other alien species on the table....
It sure would be easy to assume that old woman Carol punches is a Skrull... But there's a chance that she isn't a Skrull, and that it's a comedy bit. These movies know when to get serious and dramatic, but the 180's they make for the sake of humor happen just as often.
I can’t take her seriously lol she has no edge to me as an actress. It’s like watching a teen play dress up. If that woman from house of cards and the Wonder Woman movie was a little younger she’d be perfect
Old Lady: women's are not equal to the man's, new feminism is a garbage!
dude...In the me - too Brie fits right in...I like Brie but I don't feel Carol Danvers from Brie..Ms. Marvel always to me anyways had a sense of vulnerability..? I don't feel that with Brie...You can be 💪 yet be vulnerable in the me too era..That is what guys like me like..Not some hard edged woman looking to take out guys who have done them wrong...
Is it just me, or in the trailer she hits an old woman????
So no one is gonna point out that this woman punched an old lady 😂😂😂
this looks better than wonder woman
No creo que esto supere a Wonder Woman
Wonder Woman who?😂
we would protect "THEM"from any life threatening danger and happily give our lives protecting them,not they protecting our ass..so let the superhero-protector thing be left for the guys plzz..or I don't think there will be nothing more interesting than her boobs or tight ass into some tight cocky suit....we want strong-cool female characters with sparkling personalities,stylish,good looking,smart and all,not as a superhero plz...or they will end being in some porn parodies nothing else...
Wow! The comment section is filled with male chauvinists who cannot see a woman kick names and take ass! I am voting for Brie!
I hope its not overly feminist
Women don’t get lead roles silly 😂😂 this movie is gonna be terrible
Movie looks kinda ass... I hope this is not a feminist movie please pretty please just be equal and not overpowered.
The feminist are taking over marvel
Edit: I know shes not an actual old woman
Isn't that the girl that play superwomen
Hopefully they dont shove the feminism crap in our faces with this movie like wonder woman
please tell me that old woman was actually the villain in disguise
She's more intense than Wonder Woman, am I right?
Wonder Woman > Captain Marvel
Looks better then Wonder Woman.
Has a very wonderful woman vibe to it 
How to empower women #1
My major bone to pick with marvel is the fact that they ALWAYS have to use traits typically used for men, and give them to women, or vice versa. I get that you guys are trying to be inclusive, but gender differences and roles are NOT always a bad thing.
Batman woman? :v
I think this is 1st ever female lead character movie in the MCU & IT'S F***ING LIT!!
Get ready for some feminist crap mixed with "all males are sexists and women rule" poop. That was a horrible casting decision to go with Brie Larsen. She has no love for marvel or for the character, just an ignorant empty headed actress looking for money.
For the record, Captain Marvel was a really badass guy. Can they not find some women with some muscle tone to play Marvel characters? Looks like a Supergirl flop.
Ni está fuerte, no en plan musculada pero Wonderwoman al menos parece una guerrera
I know you're a Skrull old woman!
I'm scrolling through and all I can see are negative comments, and it just makes me sad to see people bashing up a film from the teaser trailer. Of course, freedom of speech and all, you're more than willing to express an opinion, but so many people have written off this film before it's even begun! I, for one, think that Captain Marvel is going to be an integral character moving forward in the MCU (especially in A4), so this trailer was MADE to not reveal anything. I've also seen some people saying that this is gonna be terrible because it's a female lead, and I have no words for that, just a facepalm and furrowed eyebrows. If anything, give this a chance because of the amazing score I hear in the background - you can always count on the score to emotionally charge otherwise bland scenes. I'm excited for what's coming next, keep up the great work Marvel!
Holy shit...I was waiting for this so long...most powerful woman marvel has ever had..now coming to beat thanos ass... obviously in infinity war just after 2 months..cool..😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
This movie is about be 100x more better than  Wonder Woman! mark MY words...
Ok, I'll give them a chance, it's only one trailer. But yet again we have a female fighter with her friggin hair down and getting in her face! Ladies, take a tip from Okoye and the other Black Panther gals.
Nothing cooler than a powerful woman
Hope it's not like wonder woman!
1:30 when an old woman gets on the bus before you get off
Zzzzzz female superheroes are weak af.
Meh, so Wonder Woman stile here. Just add a bit more Marvel.
Sorry but she just doesn’t look kick ass! Barbie in a leather suit!😴😴 Her voice sounds like a teenager too and the ‘I can’t remember my past life because of amnesia’ nonsense has been done millions of times before!😴 Scarlet Witch is a teenager and she’s more kick ass and exciting than this! But anyway, I want a Black Widow movie!!!!!!! Now! Natasha Romanova is AMAZING and Scarlett Johansson is totally awesome and can kick Wonder Woman’s ass with one hand! Captain Barbie...sorry Marvel looks lame! 👎🏽
Finally a woman superhero.
Knocking out old ladies like most captains, military and team captains after a few beers lol in my opinion I think the old lady is a skrull shape shifter as I can't see marvel letting one of its characters beating an old woman up
I hate women superheroes
The way she slapped that old woman is a precursor of how she finna slap Thanos
Wonder Woman VS. Captain Marvel.... Wonder Woman all the wayy!!! a little bit of bias there as well.
Nevertheless special effects looks grear, Brie as CM  looks great and vulnerable in the trailer and may be fans can not take this(as for them now she is most powerful avenger so how come she is shown like that, plus she is a woman)
So yah, this woman's gonna kick Thanos butt. *punches old lady*
Hope its not feminist propaganda
How proud I AM see woman become a superHERO🔥💕😘💪🏻
Discover..what makes her... A HERO!*Punches old woman in the face*
Hope this gets more money then wonder women. Not that i dont like wonder women, its the actor i dont like.
"Wait...the captain is a woman? Are you sure? Shouldn't it be "Marvel Girl"? 
Disney and marvel presents Green lantern wonder woman....smh yet another copy of a DC character stolen by marvel...the twilight chick has more emojis than this hoe....yawwwwn
FINALLY a female character who looks like she has depth
Literally any movie that stars a female nowadays is gonna be called feminist propaganda
Wonderwoman anyone?
This movie looks beyond awfu-oh wait, she punched an elderly woman. Nevermind, this looks fantastic.
So is everyone gonna ignore the fact that she punched an elderly woman?
Wow so empowering for women.  My wife's bf says he can't wait to see this.
2 minutes of a woman who looks constipated.
Watch out wonder woman....
Captain marvel vs wonder woman.
-wonder woman is better than you. :)
the two things I hate most are overpowered characters and feminists.
Incoming triggered people saying why it’s a woman
DC may have rushed out the first blockbuster female super hero film...but Marvel has been cooking this one up for a while.
"Discover what makes a hero" next frame: punches an old smiling woman 
Old woman: *smiles
Our female savior. We haven’t had one of those in a while  🙄
Better than Wonder Woman. Kreeeeeeee!!!!!!
And now we wait for the feminists...
marvel superwomen😍😍😍
captain marvel > wonder woman
now feminists can shut up
What makes a hero? *punches an old woman 1:30
Gotta love how the PC society makes everyone feel uncomfortable for saying movies like this look terrible. All because the main character is a woman, people think its sexist to say this movie looks pretty crappy. I would have the same opinion of a man playing captain marvel if he acted the way this chick did in the trailer. Following PC guidelines to make movies, TV shows, and video games ruins whatever product they come out with
This is bullshit 100% dissatisfaction because captain marvel was never a woman so this movie will be absolute dog shit
Marvel's wonder woman
The first marvel  universe movie that centres around a female! Bout time
I was thinking that they should have set this up with a great 90's Rock song by a female but I can't think of anything that fits.  
Imagine yourself taking a dump while constipated..... now picture Captain Marvel fighting an enemy struggling, giving it all she's got.... clenched teeth, angry eyebrows, veins popping, squinted eyes and all! I just want a female character to look that badass. The enemy is super strong, she's about to give up, but instead she doesn't give in, and triumphs over the foe.... giving it all she's got! Butt cheeks clenched and all!!!
Looks great, it feels waaaaaay less cliche than Wonder Woman, Brie Larson has been a celeb crush of mine for a long time, and I’m finally happy to see her in this bad ass form, wait...
So, why did (they)  decide to make captain marvel a woman?
Power of women💪💪💪
Why the dislikes? Looks great. DC fanboys salty still or people who are throwing a fit because she's a female?
I believe everyone is trying to get on the Wonder Woman train...
Captain Marvel has not earned the right to be the new face of the MCU. But of course a feminist arrives to save the day.
Er........meh......sure, whatever. But sheesh can we talk about her punching that old woman? Bit of a tonal inconsistancy there
1:30 to 1:32 is Captain Marvel punching an elderly woman in the face.  Your welcome.
1:40 lol finally Bat-women came to Marvel
Lol everyone are talking bout captain marvel punching an old women face 😂😂😂 btw very excited for this movie
Great, marvel copying from DC again. Wonder Woman is better
women superheroes are boring
I'm skeptical for this. I'm not that drawn unlike when the first wonder woman trailer came out. Wonder woman has only 26 million views in 1 year in its trailer. So I am not entirely sure if the hype will justify Captain marvel.
Looks good. I didn't get the same feels though as when I watched the first Wonder Woman trailer.
Will Captain Marvel be as good as Wonder Woman tho?
1:30 Yo wtf, she just punched an old woman??!
I can't wait for the part where she slaps the old woman!
thanks feminists for ruining the mcu
1:31 she just slaps up and old woman wth lol
I hope they didn't make it as overly serious as Black Panther just because it has a female lead. The thing I've really liked in recent Marvel movies is when they don't take themselves too seriously, like Ragnarok or Infinity War.
Woman always right and so much strong
This woman can beat Thanos? What a joke.
March can’t come soon enough. I’m ready to see the woman who’s gonna beat THANOS ASS
Great job Marvel you could've got that woman to be poc muslim transhender lesbian refugee but you literally had to have a white woman.
I don't know what was more cringey wonder woman or this, I know DC and marvel fight for a lot of stuff but didn't think this would be one of them. Also she can bloody fly why is she running and pulling herself up with one hand was that done to try and out show captain America with the on your left and holding a helicopter well hate to tell you marvel he caught a punch from cable and he's just a enhanced boy scout
She punched an old woman?
I thought captain marvel was suppose to be a man?. I grew up watching captain marvel and I remember him being a man. I am so sick and tired of all these politically correct feminists movies that make the women to be tougher than a man and the hero and the man to be the bad guy. Especially if he is a white man.  I would like to see how you broads do when the shit hits the fan in real life. Your not as tough as you think and your tits and ass are only going to get you so far and then your going to need a man’s help. Stupid broads.
marvel don't believe in DC there trying to kill your company please don't be like DC and make a female superman please for the love of god nooo!!! captain marvel will fail please don't kill captain america
Visually every thing looks promising so far, but her voice is disconcerting to me. It doesn't really scream renegade soldier, I would expect more assertiveness in her tone like Wonder Woman or Black Widow.
It look like shit Just saying. Not because I hate women's okay.
Also, why emphasizing that you're having a female lead? That cuts all the sincerity out of a gesture.
Wonder Woman did it right.
They’re probably gunna make her lesbian cause you can’t be a strong empowered independent woman without being a lesbian lol.
1:31 why did she hurt the old women
Honestly, I’m underwhelmed. I’m all for female equality so good for Marvel for having a lead female superhero, but this just seems like something I’m probably not gonna bother watching, especially if it’s coming out close enough to the second Spider-Man movie and Avengers 4.
Everyone's talking about how great she is. And it _is_ great that they finally have a female lead, but...she punched an old lady, for _smiling_ at her...
*The feminists are taking over*
So it's Man Of Steel Female Version ???
So nice seeing some female leads in marvel!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️
They should have used a black woman like Zoe Saldana or Jada Pinkett Smith
Acting is very much in the eyes and got damn this woman looks like she is gazing at paint drying.
Wrong women and bad trailer! How can marvel do that??? Why they do that???  Like disney killing star wars!!!!
I bet this trailer makes all the feminists's panties wet
Is anybody going to talk about how she punches and old woman in the face with no context
Do they really need to make every new superhero movie women empowerment
I hope this flops i'm tired of all this Turning super heros to women wonder women better be a man in the next reboot
When black Panther came out white men were being barred from watching the movie and got called colonizer, wonder what the feminist are gonna do for this
Can’t say I’m excited. This looks a little more DC than marvel. But I would like a spider woman film too
She just punched an elderly woman.
Is Everyone just gonna ignore that she beat up an old woman
So I'm asking is it that Captain Marvel is a Female ??...
Soo what are her powers ? she is like female thanos
Did she just punched a old women?
I don’t think captain marvel will be as good as Wonder Woman , gal had some pretty amazing moments and suites the role , Bri ... not so much. 
Eat shit Wonder Woman
Boring... Wonder Woman>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I feel like marvel could have definitely done better with the trailer. But I am excited that a mcu woman gets her own movie. I really wish black widow got her own movie though, she's badass and from what i know has alot of emotion in her backstory.
Well that looks like a loud of feminist bullshit
1:04,I hope it's not a remake of Top Gun with an Allfemale cast.
They spent so much time showing her as a woman doing normal stuff, that I have no idea what she actually does.  Other than telling us what's she's not, and punching old lady's.
Step aside Wonder Woman
Marvel's reply to Wonder woman😎
Eh, I get its a teaser but idk about this movie. For some reason I can't stand female super heroes they make me cringe, I'm not sexist they just do. I think it's the whole act tough act, "I'm not who you think I am" it doesn't sound cool or scary just cringy to me sorry, I'll still watch it since it's part of the mcu though
Thanos is tranformed into an old woman guys don't worry.
This isnt captain marvel for one its a female and two its not DC
Damn she just straight up decked that old woman tho
I think this movie will be cool but i believe wonder woman will end up being better than this
Wonder woman concept!!!
Get this woman a skrull
I would rather go for Aquaman,Shazam, Wonder Woman 84,  The joker movie.
The problem with her being female is that there is now uproar over her being stronger than almost all of the other heroes (partially due to the many pro-feminists supporting her character). I personally don’t care about that, but I just hope they don’t ruin her by giving her too much power thus ruining the film and the whole MCU. Am I wrong for thinking this way? After all, I really enjoy how they’ve made Scarlett Witch and Black Widow in the movies. They’re very strong, confident women supported by everybody. With captain marvel however, the actor is pretty “meh” and I feel like she’s going to be made into the “Superman” of the MCU, basically making everybody else look like a joke simply because of the argument that “women in Hollywood aren’t given enough powerful leading roles” which I partially agree with to an extent. Honestly I don’t know anymore...I’m just speaking my mind. Not trying to offend anyone...just a little worried for how this film will turn out.
If Gal Gadot was not casted in wonder woman then she should have been casted here as Captain Marvel. She looks tough as well. Can't imagine this character with this actor taking on Thanos!
Incoming dumb comments about how this is feminist propaganda. 
This will be better than Wonder Woman.
feminist bullshit
Hope it's as good as wonder woman 😋😋
So is this the 1st real female super hero movie, not the ones where all they do to prove themselves is to kill men... ie wonder woman, atomic blonde, etc
Nice, maybe we can finally forget about that overhyped, bad movie Wonder Woman now. The protagonist's gender or heritage doesn't automatically make a good movie. Especially considering how Wonder Woman keeps getting mansplained lol.
Sorry but is not better than Wonder Woman first trailer 🙄🙄🙄
Someone say marvel need a female Superman?
This looked like the next wannabe Superwoman show with the budget of the flash smh
There’s gonna be a ‘spider women’ soon too. Such innovation
Why captain marvel is a women? I thought captian marvel is a man 😭 this is out from my exception 😭 i'm very dissapoint 😭
A women powerful than Thanos. Gentlemen, feminist have ruled the world now.
Guess the era of half naked superhero females is finally gone...sigh
She returns home to save the earth after Wonder Woman does in the 80’s according to the  Marvel Universe timeline...
MARVEL TAKE ALL OF MY MONEY NOW......... I loved Wonder Woman, but THIS.... is about to destroy.
*proceeds to punch an old woman*
feminists ruined this hero
Looks trash, well it's movie based around a female hero so it suits it
That music is soo annoying. Well at least we finally get a proper female hero!
Lemme guess, it’s probably going to have a male antagonist, which makes it an automatic 100% rotten tomatoes, critically acclaimed, award winning movie solely on that fact of women’s rights. (Cough cough, Wonder Woman) But oh boy, if the roles were reversed, it would be kicked in the trash for misogyny. Same thing if it was a white protagonist against a black one (bad), black defeating someone white, give em an Oscar. People nowadays are preaching equal rights and anti-racism but overlook that same atrocities happening on the opposite of their narrow minded agenda.
in a way, this trailer is like green lantern, wonder woman, aquaman, man of steel and batman v superman all together (with the coloring and scenery of logan)
“Discover what makes her a hero” immediately punches old woman in the face
Well, looks like we've got another strong female character the feminists will be upset about because she's a slender, athletic military vet.
and get this woman a shield..
First one! For first solo movie of marvel's female character.
That old women is skull😎
This Wonder Woman 2 trailer looks great!
Lame another woman lead role
The Her then turns into a "A Hero" thing is way to social justice-e lol. Nobody cares if it's a woman or a man or whatever. Just stop.
The female version of superman
First of all, this looks like it has some really nice potential. Marvel doesn't spoil stuff in their trailers like DC does, they save the best stuff for the actual movie. Second of all, anyone who has picked up a comic book or watched EMH would know that that old lady is a skrull and not a human. Third of all, this isn't feminazi bs because Captain Marvel has always been a woman and yes, she is a Captain, deal with it. About time a female superhero got her own Marvel movie.
did she just hit the old woman?
Also, love how every valid criticism  of this movie is deflected as misogyny. If it continues, ain't gonna watch. Had enough of being called a misogynst by Disney's other child company for giving valid criticism. Especially since I support female rights. Sigh. Get woke, go broke.
All male superheroes look big and ethereal and out of this world! And all female superheroes are cast to just look pretty. Come on! How about a superhero that gives Superman, or Thor or Cate Blanchett in Thor:Ragnarok vibe?
Next year... We will bring you... New superhero movie... You waited so long... And today we present... Wonder Woman. THIS TIME MADE BY MARVEL!
I want to be cheerful, but I can't, because according to Brie Larson herself, she only took this role because she saw it as an opportunity to empower young women
another white women super hero killing a bunch of men smh😏 damn how many movies they gon make. don't nobody wanna see this shit😂
Wack! White woman comes out of NOWHERE and saves every fuqn marvel movie hero that came out in the past 10 years...tf
Hope movie won't be similar to..... South Park ..."Very Strong Woman"..:))
Ok, I know Brie Larson has zero screen presence, but was it necessary to make her look like she's hungover, 43 years old and kind of ugly when she's not? Besides Carol is supposed to be a pretty and feminine woman who can kick ass... well the real version of the character, not the feminazi supreme who's been paraded in comic books these last few years.
'A hero' . Then seen punching an old woman
captain marvel ll crossover to wonderwoman...sorry gal gadot but brie iz looking more kick ass n sharper than u n all credit goes to marvel
So basically this female superhero is apparently stronger then Thor who's a god in this  universe clearly lazy plot
It has a female lead REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Basic White Woman the movie lol
They are gonna ruin it with the feminist shit. Like when they did the her/ hero
She’d still get shitkicked by wonder woman 
feminist are going 😂 to get mad if this movie turn out bad "its all b3cause of white straight man".
So she's basically a female superman....ok
Marvel's version of Wonder Woman, lol.
Unreal female power.... Hell yah.
I honestly don't think it will be that good. It is not because it has a female as a lead it just doesn't look that interesting to me.
Feminists what have you done
Okay. First off this trailer looks bad. Second Brie Larsen is not the best Carol Danvers they could've cast. Third... They overlooked FOUR previous heroes to hold the title of Captain Marvel including a black woman and a lesbian woman while even having the brass plated balls to make Mar-vell a supporting character to his own legacy. 
Seems like an unnecessary counseling movie for feminists.
Dam she really just hit that old woman like that 💀😭😂
we can’t have anything nice without y’all saying it’s feminist agenda can we 😪
Bet you this will be the highest grossing female protagonist movie if all time.
I know Marvels hyping her up as their first female lead super hero movie, and she's supposed to be the most powerful MCU character. But i for one would've rather gotten a Scarlet Witch movie
“Im not what you think i am” says every women ever when filing for divorce rape
What up with female solo super hero films being flashbacks? Wonder Woman, this, and next Black widow?
wonder woman looked alot better when it first came out
I wanna like it but people are gonna ruin it for me like they did with WW and make it a feminist (cancer) thing
Great, another boring movie with feminist undertones... just what we needed.
So, I know nothing about Captain MArvel. I gather from this trailer she is a female Hal Jordan who becomes superwoman?
would she be able to beat wonder woman?
Punches Old Woman in her face, Takes the superhero name from a Orphan kid...She is a menace....
Why female not male ??? Damn
Looks like an interesting new hero take for the MCU--tons of power, already present and in control, but mangled memories--so what to do with the power and who to trust are the questions for her.  I like that she seems unassuming, even a bit passive in places.  Woman's lost her memories.  It's appropriate for her to hold back and take everything in before acting.
1:32 this is brutal, a superhero punching an old woman is simply unacceptable that too in a trailer
I think that the most amazing part in the trailer is 1:27 when it’s written HER and then it becomes A HERO. I guess she’s sort of a Marvel’s Wonder Woman but I’m still kinda excited... I especially thrilled about the after credits cause I have a feeling that it’s going to be CRAZY
Ok, it looks good, but if i don't like the movie that means that i hate women?
She hit the old woman because the old woman was a Kree in disguise, and Kree are aliens that can shape themselves to look like any being they want to look like.
Is this female green lantern?
I think I smell a strong feminist odor.
Yawn. Big yawn. Never gave thumbs down on a trailer from marvel until now. Wonder Woman commanded the screen even in the trailer. Cap marvel just seems bland. Vision has more personality than her. Step it up marvel.
The epic background music which showcases the power of Woman..that she is a goddess.!
idk why women heroes seem selfish to me. they dont seem generous like superman or captain america
beats an elderly woman 1:30
Yup definitely looks boring. Nothing worse then a woman as the main character
Oh look, anther one of my females have to play a role in a skin tight suit... 
Hello Wonder Woman
Is it a superhero movie trailer or a cliche women empowerment advertise from a third world country ???
She's definitely not more powerful then Thor, sorry feminists
Feminists are take over the world.
*immediately punched an old woman on the train*
take this Wonder Woman 84
Female super heros? What a joke!😅😅
Alright, it had blockbuster and samuel l. Jackson, so like. But she seems like a bad actress for marvel movie standards, so idk guys. Oh yeah, and feminist pandering, thats a negative too
I really hope they don't ruin her character and actually write a competent female character like Black Widow.
In my opinion this looks like some crappy Netflix show and the reaction of people will be the same as black panther. The movie will be a 5/10 but everyone else will praise it because it has a lead female role
Captain Marvel and then Black Widow right? Is Adam Warlock in Avengers 4? Who will lead the Avengers in the future since The Wasp and Captain Marvel are both present? We need more super heroes who are women... Who wants to look at dudes all day? Nevermind im not judging👀
So basically, it's the Marvel version of Wonder Woman
i'm extremely disappointed with wonder woman. i hope this lady doesn't disappoint me or i'm gonna beat thanos by myself.
The future is female...Isn't that sexist?
1:31 She punched an old women in the face (Probably a  Skrull) and also I saw Agent Coulson!!!
Wonder Woman 1984 looks great!
I already know Wonder Woman is better! 😉
I still love how people are complaining about feminist-related things in a movie trailer
I love the concept of a strong female superhero, since the avengers are mostly males. BUT, I don’t like the idea of Captain Marvel. She is too strong and I’m afraid she will overshadow many of the already existing Avengers. I’m skeptical. And Brie Larson is bland as hell. No charisma.
Wonder woman or Captain Marvel  who is ur pick?
y punch old woman
I truly sincerely want this movie to not be a pro feminist movie, and to be good. I hope they get her right the first time or they'll have to do a Black Widow who seems much cooler
Feminist power march 2019
What a shitty pointless feminist movie. HER O, was that even neccessary? Waiting for Avengers 4
yeah punch the justice into that old woman, show crime who's boss xD
Man, how i wish she mistakenly hit that poor old woman and got arrested. that would be an awesome marvel joke better than deadpool's.
It has a mountain of an expectation called Wonder Woman to climb and surpass. The trailer is fine with feminist statements written over it here and there. But at last, Diana or Carol.
Another female superhero with PTSD. How original...
It's too bad she's a feminist nutjob with a flat ass.
Why is captain marvel a woman?
About time the MCU made a movie with a female lead.
Not so great like Wonder woman ✌️
The woman has only one look for Christ’s sake! Blue Steel? Ferrari? Le Tigra? They’re the same face! Doesn’t anybody notice this?
1:30 she could have at least put some effort into boxing or some form of of martial arts so she could present herself as a superhero. This Woman's going to be the death of Captain Marvel 2.0
Wonder Woman just got kicked the f down! I doubted the capabilities of Cap M bUT I WAS WRONG AND IM SO HAPPY! THIS TRAILER IS EPIC! Music and all! IVE WATCHED IT 33 times and I still get excited
Did she just punch some old woman lmao?
Didn’t know I badly needed a female superhero so much until now OFMGNNEHAB💙💙💙💙
Atleast show a skrull for a second or something (old woman does not count). Not showing one is pure stupidity cause without one of them this trailer is extremely underwhelming and they are a major reason why people want to see this movie. We’ve literally seen everyone in this movie already in multiple films excluding CM and honestly not that many people are excited for her, it’s the skrulls they came to see.
LOL I got redirected to this trailer from some feminist website complaining she smiles more than all other marvel male heroes...Yeah if you're taking the time to calculate the time everyone smiled just to prove 'sexism' exist you seriously need to get a life. 
Why is captain marvel female I thought he was a male comic character
Wonder Woman vs. Captain Marvel mud wrestling is something I'd watch.
meh. Hopefully they can make a more exciting trailer. It's okay, but I feel its trying to be like "LOOK WE GOT A FEMALE HERO LIKE WONDER WOMAN!". I will still see it, just hoping we get another trailer that would get me excited. I wasn't excited for wonder woman after the first 2 trailers, but the third wowed me and excited. And can I say, damn that de-aging tech is awesome.
Wonder woman of MCU
Most powerful character in the MCU is a woman. Alt-right knuckleheads are gonna have an aneurysm, and I can't wait.
And get this woman a Thanos
Finally! A new female superhero movie!
In reality, woman are all heroes when they do what woman are supposed to do...same with men.
I think this trailer is great. It's mostly ugly dudes who hate women because they won't date them that are trashing this trailer.
I hate this super woman , the trailer and the movie
Look, it’s Wonder Woman 2
Oh look the trolls are out to rag on the trailer because its about a female superhero. Bring on the misogyny.
What in the actual ass is wrong with MCU....Why is Capt marvel a women.... Come-on...U gotta be kidding....
wonder woman vs captain marvel?????????????????
How come she's not a trangender black woman?
God is a woman!
Lol this scrawny chick is supposed to be more powerful than Thor ??? Thanos should rightfully wipe the floor with her but all the feminists will get triggered so we another The Last Jedi in the making here ...
The excitement is starting to set in now AHHH! The first female lead role!
I can't wait for this movie to destroy blunder...I mean wonder womans box office, DC just needs to scrap it all and start over, captain marvel is gonna kick some ass
Putas feministas
Sorry but this was underwhelming. Nothing about her really stands out like other superheros. This honestly feels like discount Wonder Woman. I did enjoy when she was flipping around and I loved when she hit that old lady. I hope she spends the entire movie just flipping and  punching the elderly, do that and I'll definitely consider pirating this movie one day 👍
*Feminists incoming*
Can someone tell me why Captain Marvel is a Woman?
They are just trying to make something like wonder women to compete with DC,But the revolution created by wonder woman is unmatchable. Marvel will never be able to achieve that much fame by this movie
I mean it’s hard to get on aboard  because of what writers are doing doing to her I actually like the actress in skull island but I just hope they do her right because this has been in the making for marvels second female super hero movie so they really have to hit this one out of the park
I am waiting por x men dark phoenix. She is better female character and is not comedy garbage.
725 thousand feminists liked this
Completely unsexy. Wonder Woman ain't bothered. At all.
I'll give my feedback.... from what everyone says is this girl seems "Dull" or expressionless. I on the other hand see a woman who is very serious yet lost and confused. She's unsure of her future and yet she is so confident with her self and her ability. Almost a "superman" vibe if you will. The vibe of this movie I feel is giving you a serious look back in to the past prior to iron man and what not. At the end of infinity war Captain Marvel was called for help and this movie is going to give a in depth flash back to her origin and purpose in the future and a possible look at where she's been during the whole lead up to infinity war. I think she plays this role well the acting is meant to be serious and I dont see where the "expressionless" face comment is coming from. I did not see any scenes that would require any "expressive" acting in this trailer anyway...
Did she just punch an elderly women
When Captain Marvel Slaps Old Woman.She didn't move even from seats with her being Powerful. Means She can sense Skrull between Humans.
1:31 Woman gets assaulted in subway (1994, colorized)
1:36 The Gal Gadot back open arms Wonder Woman shot.......
I like her more than Wonder Woman
Women.
Umm how is an old woman a threat?
The Indian film 2.0 trailer has more YouTube views than this marvel flick.Time for Hollywood to recede or is it not yet ready to accept Woman super hero??
I’m sorry I have to make this clear this is a movie about a female hero who is awesome and people who only watch stupid mcu are saying it’s bad because dumb reasons so shut up
March 8, woman's day? I see what you did there.
Not worth watching women is the lead role
I pray this wont be a feminist bullshit movie
International Women's Day, that's when this movie is going to BOMB!
Is everyone forgetting how somber the first infinity war trailer was, it filled me with doubts on whether the movie was going to be fun & funny. But with the subsequent clips it was proved otherwise and it had everyone laughing in the cinema quite often. You can't judge a 2+ hr movie based on a less than 2min trailer, it's madness. True marvel fans will be happy that the long overdue 1st female led marvel film is here. It will prove all the sexists and cynics wrong, I see the makings of a great film in this trailer.
1:28 a hero that...punch an old woman
Finally, a strong lead female who is also blonde!
Moreover, literally pull up the doctor strange trailer, iron man 3 trailer, even the ant-man trailer and ben c, rdj, and paul rudd are pulling similar serious and stoic faces throughout the 2 minutes of trailer footage. Saying Brie Larson is emotionless based on a 2 minute trailer that doesn't even feature just her in every single cut is totally ridiculous. This isn't a comedy film. It may have elements of comedy in it like tons of the mcu films do but this isn't guardians of the galaxy or thor: ragnarok. This is a different tone, different hero, different character. Photoshopping smiles onto her face is sexist and shite tbh She's a superhero. She shouldn't be smiling through every moment of the film. Was Robert Downey Jr supposed to be smiling throughout the iron man 3 trailer? No. Because that would totally upset the tone and just be stupid. Let a woman be serious ffs
What is this a female version of captain America?
Marvel just one uped DC's WHITE MALE Captain America (YUCK!). They've got a strong female captain! Get woke DC!
This is so shit I don't mean to be sexist but if CAPTAIN MARVEL IS WOMAN I'M NO LONGER A FAN it's so boring when a female is the lead sorry if I offend you I don't intend to but I can't stand it
I immediately thought this is the MCU's version of Wonder Woman...not that they're biting the DCEU but showing the movie audience how it's done better. It looks like the rumors of Chris Evans' departure is verified by this trailer: Carol Danvers seems to be in line to replace Steve Rogers' Influence in the MCU after Avengers 4: Her crashing through the roof of a Blockbuster Video store is symbolic (to me) as when Cap crashed into the ice: A hero out of time & place but strong in stature & resolve. This should result in Danvers leading the Avengers...which one-ups the groundbreaking Wonder Woman did for Females in the genre.
And so feminists have ruined the MCU just like they have ruined Star Wars. "What makes a HERo" *facepalm*
The movie is coming out on the international women’s day, gotta love Marvel
trailer for wonder woman 2 looks great
she punched a old woman dude!
Let's be honest, this movie won't be as good... Simply because Captain Marvel is a girl. The only good girl superhero is Wonderwoman.
The real was Captain Marvel was a man. Another boring ass female hero. Too much de masculinization in Hollywood today. Whats next? Thanos  is actually a woman?
Did she just punch a old woman right in the face?
I really hope captain isn’t gonna show up to beat Thanos, it would be like Wonder Woman in bvs and you know how bad of a movie that was.
This trailer is better than the whole Wonder Woman movie
Why the need to highlight the "HER"? Looks like this will be marketed in an attempt to please the feminists.
Wow. This trailer is Loud and sounds like everyother trailer. Brie Larson though? I'm in. (And seriously: "Insert: punch old woman in the face"?)
Wow that's great trailer and what a powerful Female Superhero
Ugly feminist Brie Larson
Just hope this is done like wonder woman
Her punch is weak compared to wonder woman
Old woman got bodied. RIP grandma 240 BC. - 2019
Watch this movie underperform for MCU standards and Larson going on twitter to call people "sexist" and "afraid of powerful women".
Superman knockoff origin story, with powers that make no sense and is just OP... Well just because marvel wanted a female to be OP. Dumb ass movie. Gonna ruin infinity war too it looks like
OMG she sucks! my pet rabbit acts better... plus shes a woman so shes an inferior superhero.. sorry not sorry, up yours feminists...
Wonder Woman- masterpiece for the ages (and saved the DCEU in vain)
Female version of
*Wonder Woman has been banned from the chat*
I bet anyone $10 this won't be as good as Wonder Woman or Thor Ragnarok
omg i proud of my daughter 'cause she said she want to be a superhero and she already punch old woman in the face
Old woman=Skrull
Coming in 2019...BWAAAAAAMMMM...when the world is threatened by a threat from another world...BWAAAAMMMM...one woman will have the strength...BWAAAAAMMMM...to not move a single muscle in her face...BWAAAAMMM...Brie Larson is...BWAAAAAMMM...Captain Meh-face!
A women come on now
Katheryn Winnick, Margot Robbie or any other white woman who looks like one of these two or even at LEAST look like Captain Marvel in the comics would've suited better for this movie.
Well i much prefer dc wonder woman than this tbh
I'm having this feeling in my gut that WW will still be a better female-lead movie.........but I guess I'll just see for myself
