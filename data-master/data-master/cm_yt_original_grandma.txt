dat moment when she punch the old lady..
She is half Kree half Human so she is a little void of emotion. That is on purpose. The old lady is a shapeshifting alien Skrull. Maybe do a little research ;)
Punching that old lady not cool..😂😂
Some men of steel shit
1:31 xtra xtra captain marvel punching an old lady
That old lady is definitely a Skrull, but it still felt weird to see her punch the lady/skrull.
Cool but I thought she was the most powerful? I was expecting to see Man of Steel type of shyt and all she did was punch an old lady lol
literally any superhero: looking determined, serious, got shit to do
At 1:30 if you put the speed at 0.5 you see the old lady's dentures fly out
Did I see old Nick Fury in that trailer .But he was young and looked just outta of Pulp Fiction ,meaning minus the jerry curls and the goatee .Since Samuel  L  Jackson  is cool in everything. he does ,Especially. all those cool movies from the nineties .
God I really hope that old lady isn’t a skrull and turns out to be just an old lady
What the old lady do? 😮😱😂
1:30 RIP grandma
Enough is enough with this marvel shit no creativity no originality just sucks
**punches old lady**
1:32 when grandma has no food at her house.
Seriously, why did she punch the old lady in the face?
She deadass slapped tf outta that old ass lady
Oof that was my grandma😭😂
I can totally see people punching old ladies on the bus to see if they are Skrulls
This is so shit
1:31 when your grandma doesn't make you food when you say you're hungry
Spiderman 2: yeah hold my beer.
10%: other bullshit
This movie rivals Paul Blart 2 in the best Grandma Punch.
Shits boutta be trash
The old lady scene is made just for the trailer :v
Damn is that old granny okay? 😂
*immediately punches old woman in the face*
RIP Old Lady who smiled at her
Hit like if you are here  to see her powers  to know how its gonna be ,  her vs thanos .
She punched the grandma in the head, Thanos killer confirmed.
wow she really did hate that sweet granny smile
I think the old lady is a skrull
1:31 she just slapped the shit out of that old lady
Hope that old lady is alright (if it actually is a lady)
Everybody commenting on the Granny Punch: you, ah, DO know the villains in this film are Skrulls, right? Eternal enemies of the Kree? Shape-shifters? The old lady is obviously gonna be a Skrull in disguise.
Fun facts : the marvel logo at the beginning fade from red to blue and gold, Captain Marvel's colors. When its written "Discover what make a hero" , the last frame start with "HER" that fade into " a hero". Nice little touch from the production company that did the trailer, kudos 😋
I hope the old lady on the subway was a Skrull!!!!!!
She's so plain and boring, even when punch an old lady in the face she looks bored. She only one facial expression
I’m guessing this is based in the 90’s by looking at the old metro trains
holy shit, the hype-
I was sold as soon as I saw Blockbuster
Holy shit. It's happening now. The end game is near.
Are we supposed to laugh when she punched that old lady?? 😂😂😂 lmaooo
grandma messing with da wrong girl HAHAHAHAH, I LAUGHED SO HARD
1:30 when Captain Marvel finds out grandma says she prefers Captain America.
Her: punches an old lady
The 70K dislikes are from grandmas
Oh yea *Samuel l Jackson* is Back again   hit the like
That old lady didn't thank the bus driver.
Wack! White woman comes out of NOWHERE and saves every fuqn marvel movie hero that came out in the past 10 years...tf
Y'all begged for the trailer & now it's not good enough🙉 smfh!!! It's missing something!!! It looks like a CW trailer!!! Fcking cry babies!!! They need to show more!!! And then when they do guess what y'all will say??? Thanks Marvel y'all just showed the whole movie!!!🤷🏽‍♂️🤬😤🤫 Learn how to shut the fck up & enjoy shit...fcking nerds!!!
-Shout out to the people that are holding back when it comes to judging the movie by one trailer....we still have so much to see. Any true marvel fan will be ECSTATIC to see this movie, I know I am!
honestly im not even a fan of marvel / dc but this shit looks good
1:34 it looks kinda same device  Nick fury is holding in post credits scene of infinity war.
dis looks shite
I'm waiting for this movie cuz I want to see how Nick Fury loses his one eye!Hit Like if u Agree!
Thanos is shitting himself right now 😂😂😂😂
*punch a grandma
2. Winter Soldier
Guys,that grandma 1:30 would be a skull,so pls don't blame brie for punching her 😂😊😆
Why his slap grandma??
@1:31 When grandma finds out the password to your cell phone...
*Dont bring ur grandma's to theater*
Did she punch an old lady lol🤣🤣😆
OMG... its amazing, but why did she punch that old granny ? :)
Did anyone laugh when she punched the old lady. 1:30
That Grandma getting punched somehow satisfies my forever urge of hitting an annoying, foul mouthed senior citizen
Do people really not like this trailer? This shit is badass. Also interested in seeing if Nick Fury loses his eye in this one.
Grandma didn't stand a chance!
Damn grandmas a kree
Tha old lady asked for Brie's phone number
the grandma is a skull so it deserves go be punched
Old granny: Hey, are you wonder woman
Danm marvel is really beating the shit out of DC movies lol. Dc takes forever
Wow she punched an old lady XDD okay yes i know
Old lady is a Skrull.
Ahahahah she punshed that old woman so hard!!!!!!
Ooh grandma​ that must have hurt
1:30. When you use the excuse that she's a skrull, but you really just want to punch the lady.
For beating an old lady, Captain Marvel should be promoted to Major Marvel !!
I like how she punched the old lady.
Yeah, that old lady was a Skrull, but did they have to show it in the trailer? It's a rather edgy choice for someone like DISNEY
Did she just punch an old lady???
1:28 “a hero” Socked an old women in the face literally 3 seconds later
Best was her punching the old lady on the bus
Did anyone catch her punching the old woman or?
Did she punch her gran at 1:30
Old lady: smiles
that old lady is a skrull in disguise
So it’s okay to hear old ladies now😂😂😂
Instantly punch an old lady's face.
Explain a trailer badly: Mace Windu finds a messed up and confused woman that beats up grandmas
Ppl that grandma getting punched in a skrull,  u might know if u have read some comics of captain marvel
Why in the role of captain marvel old woman ((
Who wants to watch the movie only to know what happens to old lady??
Damn she clocked that old lady lmaooo
She punched an old woman...rude... probably a skrull
She *annihilated* that old lady
Captain marvel one time I kicked the crap out of a old lady. 
The poor old lady lmao
Love it Marvel.  Keep her opponent (Super villain) a secret.  Old lady, get the F out my seat.... and digging the Pulp fiction look!  Spot on time line appropriate complete with a Block Buster stand in.
Avengers 4 better not pull of some justice league shit. She better not zoom in, one punch Thanos, rip off the gauntlet like its tin foil and him start crying and begging like "Oh please...mercy, I'm sorry" She cannot be THAT OP. Are we really gonna toss Thor and Wanda to the side they aint Gods all on their own?
Thanks is the grandma. He is going to get his butt whooped by captain marvel in the next avengers movie. 
Yay captain granny puncher! (marvel ..... might want to omit that from your trailers.... doesn't look right sitting on a super hero film, even if it'll make sense in the story)
Waiting on the punch grandma meme
Good Bye Granny!
1:31 You're in my world now Grandma (Ben Stiller voice)
* punches and old lady on a bus *
Holy shit man I can't believe 😍
When she knocked that grandma out, I knew this was my kinda movie.
That grandma must've spoiled infinity war
i think. she punch the old lady because old lady is enemy!!😂😂
Hue hue they did the blockbooster joke Ha HAAaaA Mavrel understand the POp culture :D They actually did eeet *shits pants and asks mummy for tickets with good boy points* I am a beeg lover of WAHMEN and so glad they told me she was a grill so many times or I wouldn't have known LOOol *shits pants again, it drips down my leg as I smile in awe*
I was completely sold when she landed In freaking Blockbuster!
pretty shit trailer tbh
What if Stan Lee's cameo is of him getting punched in the face by Captain Marvel?
You show that old lady who's boss!
That granny punch tho
Captain Marvel has not earned the right to be the new face of the MCU. Where was Captain Marvel when Loki and the army of Chitauri invaded New York City?
This looks good. But I'm a white Male so according to Hollywood I'm not allowed to watch this.
damn grandma abuser
She hit an old lady!!! Lmao
What if I made a batman  movie where Cat Woman was a man? Everybody would lose their shit.
Now I'm wondering why did Captain Marvel punch a old lady in the face?😱😱
Are we just gonna pretend that she didn't just knockout that grandma?
Plot twist, the old lady saves the MCU from Thanos, Captain Marvel is a double agent
lol that cgi looks like  marval vs capcom shit.
I love how she punches the grandma
Guys, she has this cold and stiff voice and is acting emotionless because Carol was brainwashed, and with it she lost her memories and part of her humanity. It's like the Kree in her is the dominant part after having her mind wiped. After she regains her memories, she will act in a more normal and "human" way. Fear not, my friends, Brie Larson is a great actress and this in on purpose.
Won't go anywhere near this movie until whats her face apologize to all the "40 something year old white guys" that evidently don't matter to her.  They must matter to Marvel Studios as who do they think have kept this studio alive through bankruptcy, Stan Lee, etc.  Way to tell all the fans to f off!  Only get away with that when you are lucky enough to play an established character.  Marvel could have done better!
*Gets Punched*
The aftermath of punching an innocent old lady in the face 1:30 is wishing you were that  FRIENDLY neighberhood spiderman you had seen on the news 1:09
Hit a Like if you think it will be a Banger 🔥❤️
when she punched the old lady I was like, "HOLY SHIT!"
Hit like if captain marvel is more powerful than thanos
So what story arc are they adapting (Carol punches Grandma in the face) Secret Invasion...they're adapting Secret Invasion aren't they?
I just shit my pants
people bitching about the trailer. y'all wild if you think marvel is gonna just drop a shitty movie before Avengers 4. it looks fine to me
nobody talking about the truth that the old woman captain marvel hit is a skrull....instead making fun of the scene!!
Woah she hit old lady what the hell
1:31 *punches an old lady in the face*
Damn. She punched an old lady.
1:30 Ohhh so this old lady is Thanos.....
She punches skrull in old lady form🤣
Holy shit !
I’m sorry but did Captain marvel just punch an old lady square in the jaw?
Im noticing a lot of people are mentioning grandma 
The skulls look like shit
Marvel just take my wallet my house and everything...I'm sold
the grandma is a kree or skrull 
Let Grandma be great 😂😂😂
Trailer would have been bad ass if that old lady turned back after being slapped and said *_all that  for 1 drop of blood_*
*Wonder if Captain Marvel Punched Stan Lee instead of granny*
Looks shit to me
1:30 r.i.p granny
This might sound racist but I usually don't find white women attractive, but something about this woman playing captain marvel I just cant take my eyes off her my goodness she is beautiful.
Poor granny, she didn't deserve that.😢
This trailer is kind of a let down for me, after infinity war, just to go back like 30years when fury had both eyes. Idk, it just goes off on another limb and I need a4, not a grandma punching girl with amnesia.
WTF at 1:29 she slaps a old lady srsly tho what a hero
It is not very nice to teach women to hit their grandmas.
I don't know much about captain marvel so I'm not to excited for this movie but seeing her punch an old lady skrull was funny but I'm worried that she's just gonna come into avengers and kick thanos's ass and not let anyone else have some spotlight because she doesn't deserve it yet
Yessssssss hit like if you want its credit scene relates to infinity war 2
1:30 1 like = 1 prayer for that old lady
That old lady didn't give up her seat and Capitan Marvel said BOP on her forehead..... I'll leave
Grandma getting knocked out, say whaaaaat, cant wait for this movie
Punching the Old lady like (cringed)
Feminism goals 2019 punch butch ass grandmas
The grandma is a scroll
Captain Marvel better be scared that old lady is tough
Looks a bit shit but hey, it's made by Marvel, i'm sure the movie will be good.
Cap Marvel..I'm coming for ur head..just like i did with the granny..dumbfuck.......###
Is that grandma a Skrull or something?
They are gonna have to work overtime to make this movie seem like a big deal and a must-see event.  Because this trailer didn't do that.  Neither does Brie Larson here.  I know people want to stay away from the Wonder Woman comparisons and her vs Gal, but one thing Gal has over Brie by spades is her face acting. That is what sold me on Wonder Woman a lot.  Brie just doesn't capture the same kind of face acting and emoting that gets me invested.  And the trailer doesn't do that either as well as screwing up her origin story.    
Hmmm is it just me or does the CGI looks shit? Also it looks a Bit like the Ryan renolds green lantern Movie... weird but Hey it looks Good so far and Captain marvel dosent looks too over powered and it seems like she has a character beyond beeing just an ubermensch
Damn she hit the granny...
Its not cool to punch an old lady who just smiled at you. 🙄🤔
“it’s hard to explain” “I’m not what you think I am” if this movie’s gonna be full of shitty cheesy lines then meh
Did she just right hook an 80 year old women? 
Turn that shit around and say the future is male then all hell breaks loose.
Calling it now old lady is a skrull
SLJ... punching old ppl... ok. I’m in. 🤪
"I'll hit them with all the feminism I got!"
sigh another tedious marvel super hero movie.. *punches innocent grandma* ohh shit!!!
Wow...nick still haven't lost his eyes when he know captain Marvel...they r old fd
Woowwwwwww. Hit like.
Can people stop with the "WHY DID SHE HIT AN OLD LADY". For all those who never read the comics, the old lady was probably a skrull in disguise.(a skrull is one of those green aliens that was in the trailer and they have the ability to shapeshift.
The grandma did nothing wrong
🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🙌🙌 DC fans hitting dislikes😒
This shit is gonna bomb
2 - She gets up and goes to chat to the little old lady. Normal moment.
bre Larson sounds like a 13 year old girl in this movie...i hope she can sell the film.
After that meteorite hit .the blockbuster appear .new mode Fortnite ft Marvel pls .
woa did you see that, this Mary-Sue punched an old lady right in the face!
Not sure if casting is right fit for the lead character. We needed a chiseled blonde white woman with a slightly different face. Not sold on this one.
* Punches an old women...
Punching grandma  will be meme of the Week
Excited 😆 but this first trailer was a bit underwhelming. You know KF is probably holding the good stuff for the second trailer!!
Look guys, this is clearly a cultural difference. On Hala, the proper greeting for the elderly is precisely a punch to the face. I can't believe you are all so insensitive to such noble Kree custom.
Was so disappointed at 1:30 when she hit that old lady
Well this was shit trailer
the old lady didn't thank the bus driver *marvel got triggered*
Who will win: grandma or captain marvel
Grandma: Aquaman's trailer is way better than yours!!!
Still not knowing shit about what is happening...
My friends told me its the worst trailer .but I didn't expect it to be this f...kin worst
RIP Old Lady
Her acting is shit
Punching women NO 👎
Granny shouldnt have been talkin shit!
Captain marvel: *punches grandma*
I bet the stanlee cameo in this movie is wen cap marvel hits tat old lady stanlee would be beside the old lady and like "hey kid tats my wife u just beat up"
the grandma part was the best xD
Maybe the trailer is trying to throw us off and she really punched Stan Lee in the movie 🤔
Me: One, that's not an old lady. It's a skrull *disguised* as an old lady. ALSO IS NO ONE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A BLOCKBUSTER THERE??? MARVEL JUST ANSWERED HOW 90S THIS MOVIE WAS GINNA BE
That old women is skull😎
Waiting for the movie just to find out why did she hit granny at the train :D
I've never like captain marvel so i was hoping this was gonna be good but this trailer is so boring and generic like black panther was like mix up the formula not the same old thing every time
You know a superhero trailer isn’t great when the only fight scene is literally against an old lady instead of some badass villain
Oh so a woman can punch an old lady, but a man cant??? Oh ok...ok...ever had to wait for 10 minutes for one of those to cross the road?
DISCLAIMER No grandmas where punched in the making of this trailer.
Yup strong women like to punch old women......Thats how the world works
I like the part where she wacks the old lady 🤣
Tell that to the old lady you punched
Thanos - "well shit"
not quite sold on it, i'll see it when it releases.
She gibe grandma smacc
*Thanos shits pants*
I love Captain Marvel those who like hit a like 👍
Screw you grandma!!!
why did she beat that old lady?
*pimp slaps old lady*
"what makes a hero" I don't think to punch an old lady is not an act of heroism 1:32
Brie "White Guys Don't Get to Have Opinions" Larson
Did captain marvel just not my granny’s teeth in. BITCH them teeth were $50 BUCKS
Thread: "Ehh, doesn't feel Marvely. She punched an old lady? She's supposed to be badass? Not impressed"
OmG guys, she hit my Gramma!
I am sorry but when she punched Granny I just laughed 😂
punches a grandma hahaha
Y'all talking about grandma.. its Thanos disguised as grandma! its in the comics.. thank me later!
Honestly, kind of cliche and boring. Just didn't get the feel and thrill as we did in previous marvel trailers. I don't want to lambaste Captain Marvel yet just on the basis of this trailer but initial trailers are very critical and are supposed get the fans in. Undoubtedly, Shazam and Aquaman trailer is top of class as of now. I have watched Shazam trailer like 20 times now and I'm telling you if I go watch that trailer again, I'll still enjoy it. Here, the trailer gets a bit interesting only after she punches Stan Lee's sister (respect your elders C.M.). Anyways, I hope the upcoming trailers and the final product is better. After all, Captain Marvel is an important character and if they mess this up... 
She hits the old lady because she's a Skrull acting as an old lady, lol.
10% comments about actual opinions 90% about the grandma being bashed
this is gonna go straight to the shitty marvel movies list.
Over rated trailer This shit looks like a netflix series
Hah, told ya, wonder woman is hotter than this movie :*
1:30 when your grandma keeps asking you "when are you gonna get a job"
Well.....marvel now punching old ladies in the face, but, happy to fire James Gunn for posts he made many many years ago 🤔
Watch the Old Lady being punched thing not even make it to the final film
She punched a old lady 
Lemme just hop onto Instagram to see all the old lady punch memes
Old lady: "Captain Marvel, say SHAZAM!"
Hit like  if you're  form  India
When Captain Marvel punches the old lady I laughed so hard I turned to dust
okay. first half humanity is lost because thanos has do.. second.. i think captain marvel should be againts thanos... not old creepy lady.. third i am iron man :D
Why tf did she hit the granny?
*immediately punch a grandma*
1:30 when your Granny sends the card but forgets the money
did captian marvel just sucker punch a nice old lady lmao
Granny probably deserved it.
Wait, why'd she punch an old lady?
Granny skrull , yassss
You know it’s old school when we see blockbuster video lol
it looks very bad...like black panther...who cares about this shitty hero? Bring another Iron Man for example
The wolf was dressed up as grandma again from Hoodwinked
To Everybody talking shit about this movie: we know you are going to see it anyways
Wtf she hit an elderly
Trailer got good when she punched the lady (probably a Skroll)
why she punched that old lady.
1 Like = 1 Prayer for Grandma who got smacked
Captain Marvel the granny abuser
Why did that old lady get punched
That grandma farted and was grinning at her! What choice Capt. marvel had?
Sorry if I sound like an 80 year old man ranting about politics
'"Discover what makes a hero" Next clip shows her punch an old lady.
Gotta love a hero who would King punch an old lady😂 (and yes I know it is most likley a skrull)
This woman is disrespectful, punching a granny like that?
1:30 - 1:31 punching that old woman was ruthless lol.
I'm totally dazed, did she just punch an elder? 😐🤔
Well...after pushing feminist agendas with this movie and after the comments of Brie Larson about white critics you could expect a good first trailer at least but I think marvels goal for this movie is to disappoint fans from the get go
1:31 when you don't want to give old people
1:30 did she just slap the old woman?
Okay but did she just fuckin smack that grandma?
People waking up early to shit all over the trailer before its even out. It's the first trailer so its not going to give away much. I am personally very much on board. The skrulls alone bring with them a host of plot angles that haven't been played with before.
I'm pretty sure that the old lady is a SKRULL.
had the pokemon center music playing made this trailer far better tho saying that i wasn't really paying attention to anything, i saw a blockbuster and a young nick fury and thats about it oh and she hit an innocent old lady every thing else was ust like flashing lights to me
Grandma just got memed
why so mad she hit grandma :(
Falling into a Blockbuster has me sold!
Yay, yet aNother stupid super hero movie made for 55 year old basement dwelling man babies. Make 500 more this year please!! lol
Everyone’s saying about the grandma but I’m guessing that was a kree as they can disguise to hide from people
So Blockbuster is now used to visually estsblish the past? Cool, I feel old.
Did she just punch a Granny?!!!!!
That grandma was Aunt May
She punched an old lady, WTF!?
Would a hero punch an old lady???
Did she slap a grandma XD
Eh... could still be good but I'm not quite sold.  Still... if this is where the MCU starts to crash and burn, at least it was a good run.
1:31 *When grandma won't let you have a cookie*
I definitely have an opinion on this trailer, but as a white male, Brie Larson does not care or want me to share it. Which probably means I shouldn't see this movie either. Too bad, cause I was super stoked for it before she said my opinions don't matter. Guess I'll just give my money to something else. Maybe she can refund me for Room and Free Fire since I probably shouldn't of saw those either, my white male gaze judging her performance. I feel so much shame. Sorry, Brie.
This movie looks like complete shit!!!! Omg I cant believe how bored i was during this trailer.
Why did she hitbthe lady
Looks shitty already. Captain Marvel marks the day Marvel died.
A hero who punches old ladies.
So, we're not gonna talk about the fact that she just punched an old lady?
Hiyyaa!!!  Grandmaster 😂😂😂
Fury lost his eye because Captain Marvel punched him for ogling her.
Some may have been expecting smth different while others may just be bat shit crazy 
Grandma: Call a judge, get some fudge
That poor old lady...press F to pay respects
This shit is legit
Did Captain Marvel just hit a grandma ( 1:30)
Yo shit punched the shit out the lil old lady lmfao rip in peace 💀
How to be a hero punch 🤛 a grandma 👵

1:31 DANG !! That grandma got knocked out 💀💀😂😂
Anyone else getting a Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern vibe from this trailer?
That old woman is an evil lady
Why she hit the old lady
Amazing trailer & i think captain marvel hits SKRULL who is in the old lady form in the trailer.
when it showed the Blockbuster , you knew the year was gonna be old
Did captain marvel just punched an old lady?!
When you get so hyped that you hit a grama
I honestly give zero shits if this movie is bad or good im a still wach it lol
To the Haters and dumbfucks wondering why she punched the character, Watch again until you hear her say "I'm not what you think I am"
Punches an elderly woman. The hero that will beat thanos...
If it's not too much trouble, one little mid-credits scene tying Coulson and the Kree to the Tahiti Project would really be nice.
Just here to watch the grandma get slapped 👀
poor grandma 😥😥
Grandma is actually black widow with the hologram face tech, that she used on the winter soilder
I am disappointed with that old woman hitting scene...whatever they show, may be that old woman is a bad guy in disguise, but she actually hit her... that's bad! :-/
This shit looks sooooooo stupid.
meh, poor old lady tho
Why tf did she punch that old lady?😱
NICK FURY IS YOUNG WHATTTTTT! ALSO WAS THAT COULSON!! EEEeeeeeeee!! Also doo you think that old  lady was evil?
The old lady is a skrull they can shapeshift
White people are so desperate to be oppressed even in the fictional world aliens wanna attack them first
Holy shit this trailer is wrecking YouTube
Smack that old lady
The faq is this blockbuster shit, that stores been closed for yeeears
*Avengers: She Just Hit A Old Lady*
Skrull Private: Uh sir we just got word from Agent Larry...he's currently in an Earth Hospital with a broken jaw something about Captain Marvel punching him in the face
She can take Thanos. She punched an old woman.
What if the old lady is not a skrull???
She punchs a granny!!!
That Granny : u mean SHAZAM
It’s basically a teaser trailer but it’s awesome...she slaps the shit out of an old lady I mean come on!
Deadass saw her two piece an old lady, anyone else ?
I wasn't sure about this movie until I saw captain marvel punch that old lady. Now I'm sold!
1:31 did she just punch a granny ?
Edit: Even if she is a Skrull, why do they need to have that part in the trailer without any buildup or hint the old lady is a Skrull? Makes Captain Marvel look bad.
What makes her a HERO **punches an old lady** Nice edit, Marvel. By the way I'm calling it right now. Fury's a Skrull.
Why she hit that old lady though 🤣 ...
She threw hands at ol' grandma lol.
Did they even bother with de ageing tech on Sam Jackson? That guy is eternally young, like he's an immortal with a 40 year olds face.
1:31 when grandma puts raisins in her cookies
5 minutes silence for the Grandma being smacked....
i think CAPTAIN MARVEL punched GAL GADOT's grandma.😂😂😂😂
This is The one marvel character that I dislike, like ok where do you get those powers from? Flying and stuff with no history of god DNA or relativity to any of the stones and also a human who is also only 50 years old? I’ve read the back story and I think it’s stupid, each character gets there power from their uniqness and this one is just plain stupid, NEXT
This movie is important for some. This is the second SOLID female superhero movie in the golden age of superhero movies, I know is not significative in numbers but is important to me.         (=^-ω-^=)
Who else shit their pants
Plot twist: It actually was an innocent old lady
She just... punched an old grandma
Is Everyone just gonna ignore that she beat up an old woman
Imagine if that old lady wasn't a skrull.
Also, she smacked a granny in the face. Clearly, much better than Thor.
holy shit this is amazing
Punches XD
Straight right to the old lady. No context needed here. Clearly she wouldn't say thank you for giving up the seat.
1:31 punched Grandma confirmed for Nintendo smash Bros!!!!!!
You know I think that old lady could have been the super skrull because that character can actually shape-shift
Avengers fan hit like 👍
Ah shit BlockBuster Video!
She punched my grandma
So Captain Marvel has a negative shade as we saw in the end..Doesn't bother !! She is going to rock !!! Hit like for Brie Larson.
1:31 ,when ur grandma says henry cavill will not be superman....:)
I know the granny was a skrull but still.
Holy god!!!!! I can’t wait for this shit!!!!
I bet half of those 25k people that disliked the video were because of the old lady
Holy shit i'm actually so hyped for this
On the other hand, 1:30 when grandma asks you how to turn on the tv. (or is that just my grandma :thinking:)
1 LIKE = 1 RIP for the old lady
I like how she punches the old lady 😂
This movie is like shit
When grandma force you to eat when you’re already full
I’m just so not sold on this movie. Like exactly what are the selling points? There’s a woman in the lead role. Check. It’s marvel studios so we know the movie will be entertaining and well shot. Check. And Sam Jackson. Besides that, why should I want to see this movie?
Did Thanos turn into grandma?

Apocalypse chokes Raven - promoting violence against women! Captain Marvel socks old lady - promoting violence against the aged! No, promoting violence against Skrulls *disguised* as old ladies.
Hey guys we need to capture the 90s feel. Throw in Blockbuster and Pagers! What about tamagotchis? Cool idea man, we can have her play one while punching a old lady in the face. That will be "da bomb!"  We need to get Val Kilmer in this movie too and have him rock some reeboks and aviators. That will work!
Getting The Winter Soldier and Gotg vibes from this, amazing!
Why she over here punching grandmas!
I only came here just to see her punching the old lady.
When Grandma doesn't come through with the baked goods
Oh yea ...another super hero movie......just never gets old.....
She socked a kree shapeshifter into an old lady. Common misconception
Most of the people watching this probably don't know the real reason why Carol hit the old woman lol
*Punch an old lady*
Here comes the Captain Marvel punching a grandma... XD
Is it the Granny or Brie, a scrull in disguise?
Calls her a hero... Just punch an innocent old lady on the face for no reason
Marvel just has the ham game by the teets.  It's doesn't matter how much they market the film. Money is money. But I do firmly believe they do a fantastic job at cornering the best for legacy. Kevin feige is an animal comic entrepreneur by design and passion. This road is paved uniquely. Avengers 4 is her time. Livestock the shit out of this product. Including paying x amount 's of dollars to keep this trending on spewtubes
Thank you! Finally a REAL trailer, not those bull shit "concept" clickbait video from smasher
Green screen , CGI, and some more of green screens on dont forget CGI oh shit wait and green screens....and a lot of CGI
This is going to be a shit movie
1:31 that old lady didn’t thank the bus driver
She punched an old lady so idk if i wann watch this now
ive watched this idk how many times already just to see she punched the skrull lmao
Ohhh Shittt --- Its ON AND POPPIN!
i think the reason why this trailer doesn't really excite me is because of the fact it's about a white female.. like i want to see something Unique and different. but still im eager to see the first reviews about this movie and see if it's worth ma time :P
She went for the head on the old lady
I think that old lady is her enemy
why did she slap that old lady?
Lmao she punched the old lady but can’t wait for this movie it’s gonna rock
Here is hoping I can use the Blockbuster camo to sell my old uniform as a vintage antique.
blockbuster Capitan marvel hit like fans
Here before it hits #1 on trending :P
So the pudgy chick from 21 Jumpstreet is gonna beat the shit out of Thanos?
Holy shit nick fury's got an eye
When she punched that old woman ;0
She punched a god damn old lady in the face. Movie, you have won me over
The EW article describes Brie Larson's character as a 1990s United States "Air-Force-pilot-turned-intergalactic-hero," and who is part Kree (alien) and part human (according to a subsequent online EW article, her super powers derive from the Kree part of her DNA).    The arch enemy of the Krees are the Skrulls ("the notorious Marvel baddies made all the more dangerous by their shape-shifting abilities").  Hence, it's a safe bet that the "old lady" that Captain Marvel hits is not human, but actually a shape-shifting Skrull (at 1:29 in the trailer, we get a brief glimpse of some of the pointy-eared Skrulls in their true form).  The Krees and the Skrulls are at war and that war ends up being brought to earth.  The EW article says of the movie, "...when it begins, Carol already has her powers.  She's left her earthly life behind to join an elite Kree military team called Starforce..."  "But before long, Carol finds herself back on earth with new questions about her past."  
This shit is gonna be horrible
First superhero to punch a granny?? I hope she didn't Johnny English 😂
For anyone confused (highly unlikely) she’s punching an old lady bc the enemy in this movie is the skrull alien race. A race that can change form and look like anyone.
Grandma - "i don't feel so good"
I just shit my pants.
Truth be told I was ready to hang it up.
Wtf did she hit an old lady on 1:31 I think she is rude
*sees CM punch elderly lady* 
Hit like for her cuteness😍😘
Captain Marvel punching an old lady in the face might be one of the funniest thing I’ve seen all year. I know she’s probably a skrull but still.
Wtf?! Why would they put a scene of her punching an old woman?? 😂
Old lady is Thanos' Mom.....(makes audible explosion sounds) Shocker - I know right?!!
Oooohhhhhh shit Thanos bout to go downnnnnnnnn
1:30 When Granny shows your crush your embarrassing baby pics
Why she punch old granny :o
why did she punch that old woman in the subway
I came here ready for the advancement of the MCU but all I can think about is grandma
97% of the comments are about 10 year olds mentioning something about the old lady skrull
punching old people as u do
Come on...be honest.  You've wanted to sock an old lady too.
looks shit, aweful trailer.
Waiting for avengers?? Hit like
OK kids if u want to know why she punches an elderly lady?  If you knew about the secret invasion and the kree-skrull war, then you would understand... Probably
If this movie has any feminazi propaganda bullshit in it, Im not gonna watch it. Or Avengers 4 If she is in it. "Women are strong" "Women are smart" "respect women" we get it stfu. Women want to be equal but they never will be. Meh will always be stronger and smarter than women because thats how nature works. So please Marvel, for the love of God don't turn this movie into a gut wrenching, vomit inducing womens rights movie because they have been equal for years, and have plenty of benefits over men.
Aww Poor Grandma
I couldn’t care less for the other criticisms of her acting or the plot. The only issue I saw was that punch.
The old lady must be DC die hard fans 😂
Glad to see all of the Straight White Men™ to let us know that they'll be steering clear of this movie. Keep it up!
I think that grandma was a skrull
Punch an old lady in the face?  Bland expression.
And yes while most of us fans know that old lady that got punched was a Skrull, its still funny and so are these amazing comments. 😂😂
Crashing into a Blockbuster and punching an old lady. I give it 9/10!
Plot twist , the old lady was thanos
She punched that poor old woman in the face lol
Old lady slapping is a meme now. Wonderful.
Just so everyone knows the old lady is a skrull lmao
Plot twist, the old lady is the main villain
*Sees an old woman get punched in the face* "Wait what...?" *Watches it again confused* What...? *Watches again for entertainment...Laughs...Feels bad for laughing*.
So many people at my school are like, why did she punch an old lady? And I’m just like, “LEARN SOME MARVEL YOU UNCULTURED SWINE!”
1:30 Did she just punch the shit out of that poor old lady?
Captain Estrogen lol.  I'm good this shit is silly.
Did she just punch an old lady!!
Another white savior hurray.... I'm so excited.
Bruh didn’t think she would have the voice of a 13 year old coming into this
Relax the grandma is propabli a shapeshifting skrull.
Seems to be an other bullshit movie.
"a hero" *punches my grandmom*
This gona be shitty
"I don't want to hear what a white man has to say." - Brie Larson
Are that grandma on disguise? Tf she punch grandma 😂
Discover... what makes... her.. a hero... *punches old lady*
Me watching it and the first three seconds: "Oh shit A Blockbuster"
Isnt the old lady a Skrill?
Needs more old lady punching.
Holy Shit She Just Knockedout An Old Lady💔😭
She just punched an old lady did I miss something?
wtf is up with her punching an old woman? 😱
Whats up with her slapping the old woman?!
3. How rude of her to yeet an old lady like that! Does she have no manners? >:( (And, yes, I know it's a Skrull in disguise. I just wanted to make fun about the scene itself.)
Of course they had to get this out when feminists are at their peak of being annoying pieces of shit. I'm sure that they won't be blowing anything out of proportion just because she's a wahmen.
Don’t get me wrong I liked the trailer but I wish movies-superhero movies especially- would stop giving away major plot points or twists or showing clips of what is supposed to be something powerful or amazing in the trailer. I was really hoping that we would not see her going binary at all and it would be saved for the movie. Or even be saved for A4. This is my big problem with these trailers lately. The worst one that comes to mind is BVS showing wonder woman saving Batman from doomsday. Why would you spoil that in a trailer! But DC isn’t the only offender. The Thor Ragnarok trailers gave the entire plot away! Don’t get me wrong the movie is great but I would rather have not known going in that: Thor was going to lose his hammer, get taken to the grandmaster played by Jeff Goldblum, have to fight Hulk, team up with his brother, and go back to Asgard to fight Hela. Oh and I wish I had not known that Surtur was going to show up either. I got all of that from less than six minutes over three trailers. It’s not the only Marvel movie or even superhero movie to do this but that one is the one that sticks out the most to me. Leave some mystery! I mean you’re not adapting straight from the comic books anyway so let there be at least a few surprises in the theater. Rant concluded. 😬
How is she a hero she just punched an old lady smh
Mcu fans hit like ❤  from India
She just punched an old lady. Wow.
Granny: "Oh, hello there deary." :)
So is this based in the past before the avengers assembled cause this shit makes no sense to the story line right now and what about the atom thing in gaurdians of the galaxy 2 when is he coming into play?
I am sick of this superhero bullshit
Yo did i just see the nova corps or am i trippin balls? And are we just gonna ignore how she socked the shit out of my grandma?
1:31 is when your grandma doesnt shut up and keeps on telling you to take more cookies

But! Am I the only one who have seen that old Lady Punch seen more the 10 time?🤔 but she Punched her still didn't get that🙄
did she punch an old lady?
A fullpack version of total. shit.
SPOILERS When Carol punched the old woman, was I the only one who thought she could be a Skrull? Carol is of the Kree and the Kree and the Skrulls have major beef in the comics. The Skrulls were kind of owned by FOX (cos they were part of the F4 licence) but now though....
It's a mixed shit of Marvel & DC 💩💩💩
I'm definitely intrigued. My only question is why didn't Nick Fury go to her when Loki and the Chitauri showed up?
Captain marvel- hits the elderly
I Feel Bad for Grandma
damn that granny is in heaven right now
Did she just straight up punch an old lady😂😂😂
Hit like if you think this movie rape your brain

Meme of grandma just begin
Strange: (holds up a dog) It's inside this dog.
That old lady might have been a skrull because why would captain marvel randomly punch a elderly
*Old Lady riding public transport*
Should have cast a black transgendered bisexual dwarf. Instead we get another white women. Get WOKE already.
That punch tho. 🤐
Okay, i laughed way too much as she just hit the old woman in the bus.
Why isn't this movie out yet?  Why do we have to wait for 2019?  Why do I have to ask these questions... F*CK you Marvel, hurry up already, I have to pee but I'm holding it until after the movie. (True origin story)

This trailer was too much..seeing that Blockbuster Video outlet really hit me. WTF Marvel.

Thanos will be pleased when he see that shity trailer

*A HERO* ;proceeds to deck out grandma;
1:31 *She Just Punched an Old Lady* 👵 
So are straight white men not allowed to see this as brie as said she doesn't want them around?

The Granny Hitter
The grandma jokes are starting to get old...

I felt very triggerred when she punched the old lady but  I still like the trailer
Anyone remember all the porn blockbuster sold? Just me?
You removed X & Peep song #1 trending for this shit
Nick Fury in Winter Soldier..
How she gonna have time to curl her hair before fighting shit. Why do they make girls have their hair done nicely in order to kick ass?
Holy shit nick fury look so young
I should have worn my white pants today.
Damn she slapped the shit out of that grandma 😂
Captain Marvel: -Punches an innocent old lady-
So is the villain a sweet old lady?
I hope, when the movie comes out, it turns out she just punched a regular grandma.
I guess at her time, a hero means punching an old lady?

I think everyone was shook when she socked the grandma
Super hit movie 😊 jackass 🤘
did she just punch an old lady? 1:30
Soooo...the crap in the comics hss finally hit the movies...
I’m more hyped for aquaman and Shazam both those trailers were fun and we saw the actors looked like they gave a shit but here the trailer felt like 2:30 minutes and not 1:57 minutes Brie Larson was also really bad in this trailer, I say it’ll be as good as iron man and Thor 2 both decent movies that are really boring
Holy shit, you guys are totally funny, showing a blockbuster
Dont punch old granmother
And that old lady is such a Skrull agent!
Feeling Bad for Old Lady
The old lady was sitting on her spot.
i hope that old lady she punched the shit out of was a villain...or marvels gonna catch some heat (lol)
Damn captain marvel! Why u be punching an old lady?
I really hope the old lady was a skrull.......
Only reason is going to be a hit because of nick fury!!

Grandma:Are you captain marvel (DC) 
1:31 When grandma keeps on offering me food.
Sorry, Miss Granny! 😱 #1 Trending in the Philippines 🇵🇭
This looks terrible, ain't gonna let my daughter have Brie as a rolemodel when she said she hates white people.
Sam Jackson is like 80 years old, but looks likes he's mid 40.... Blk Dont Crack
Imagine if that old lady she punched wasn't a Skrull
Hit every mark on my checklist; establish, set the table. Looking forward to March!
Im sure that the old lady punched in the face is a skrull
*Punches Old Lady In The Face*
So much hate in these comments over Captain Marvel being "emotionless" or "a robot" or "not smiling." Ever think maybe, just maybe, IT'S PART OF THE STORY?! With a decade of hit after hit, Marvel has earned my trust, and Brie Larson is a phenomenally versatile award winning actress. Guess what, she knows how to smile. Ever see Community? Kroll Show? NTSF:SD:SUV? She's a comedic actress! If she's stoic in this film, there's probably a reason for it. So shut up, and watch the fuggen movie.
You guys..saw her punch the old lady too right
This is a joke i don't know whether she hit a skrull in disguise or just hit an old lady
Lmao when she punched the grandma that actually shocked me
Now I know why Granny wants to kill people
*punches granny*
1:30 i fell so bad for the grandma
*Punches old lady
Wait up.  Coulson with a full head of hair looks more like the Arnold. I can't quite compute
Marvel you lost me at the HER to HERO thing. Hard pass on this movie, I won't pay for another Hollywood studio to preach their political bullshit to me in their movies. It's why I don't watch Star Wars anymore, don't follow Kathleen Kennedy's example.
Hit hit hit...😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘
He got hit by a bus
will she look older in avengers 4?
I miss Billy Batson's Captain Marvel over this shitshow
Guys! Chill out about the old lady. The main villains in this film are shape shifters. We good?
Other people think that Grandma was a shapeshifting skrull as well?
What makes someone a real hero is punching an old lady for a bus seat
Are you the women who punched the old lady
This movie will not be criticize because the hero is a woman ohhh shitt!! U know what i mean 🤣🤣
Punches the elderly
I got so sad when she hit the grandma :(
Did she just hit old lady
Guys relax the old lady is probably a skrull.........I hope.
Apparently punching an old lady in the face makes her a hero,I mean I do that all the time and nobody calls me a hero
--Captain(Colonel) Marvel punches Grandma in train--
*Punches an old lady for no reason*
Ohhhhh shit they actually released it
Granny punching = hyped
i think grandma stole her seat or grandma said shazam is better than u
She really clocked that old bag huh
Menuda" shit " de trailer. Va ir al cine su puta madre. Esto es otro han solo...
I am not used to this much protagonist in my female characters....Quick, make her punch an old lady so I know who the real hero is.
RIP old lady ???-????.....She shall be missed and Captain marvel should RESPECT WHAMEN
Punching a grandma
*"How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man?!"*
1:31 when my grandma makes bad cookies
I think the grandma she punched is a skrull
Damn.... blockbuster comin back from the dead. Forget marvel I’m here for our oldest friend who gave us movies that were so easy to steal.
Old lady was def a skrull
The Best Scene Is gonna be The poor old grammy
*Slaps an old lady*
The hero we all need, to stand against all the grandmas who keeps feeding us after we're full.
Stan Lee as the husband of the old lady that Carol punched in the face, that would be funny 😂😂
How you know this is old blockbuster was at the start
that grandma is an alien probs :/
Old lady is a Skrull
already outsold every other marvel movie
1:30 that punch 😱😱😱
Holy shit Nick Fury with two eyes!
Punched a grandma. Badassery level: LEGENDARY.
I really hope that old lady she punched  was a skrull
So we just gunna ignore the fact that she just punched an old lady in the face "that poor old lady"
ahaggshjsdJSdd i'm mad because she hit the old lady. yes, we don't know the whole story but still fgasfdfahgdfah it's an old lady!
I’m gonna watch this just to see her punch an old lady
1: 31 when that weird old lady smiles at you for no reason
A skrull stooping so far as to disguise itself as a granny? That’s low, bro. But I guess that’s what skrulls are like, lol
*Slaps grandma*
Thanos: Hold my beer.
Why did they include grandma scene in trailer? Lmao
when she punch the grandma she probably think it was thanos is face smiley
I lost my shit for a second when i saw this
It's not an old lady it's a skrull get educated KIDS
That oldie punch surprised me 😁
Looks like shit, I dont get the hype.
Hit like for captain marvel. Thanos need a new army by the way.
That old lady had it coming. Being all old and shit.
Punching an old woman, worst avenger ever xD
Seems like shit
i feel like its gonna be shitty
why the heck did she punch a grandma
Any tamil nadu hit like
My grandma is offended because of this trailer
That old lady had it coming
Seems as vague as Green Lantern and she punches a smiling old lady.... that's all I got out of the trailer.
I really hope that’s just a normal old lady that got Detroit Smashed in the face.
She abuses old people.  My type of character lol.
here before it hit 500k
A QUEEN. I hope everyone who talked shit about her (but will also still see the movie) eats their words. Aye aye, captain.
Lol dat grandma 👵 HAHAHA
Does punching an old woman in the face makes captain marvel marvellous?
But will instead complain on how shit the trailer is
So nick fury told first idea of Avengers initiative to cpt marvel but she turn down idea but give call to come rescue when they need give him space pager
Skrulls were known to be shape shifters. Take that old lady!
At 1:30, slow down to .25. She punches grandma's dentures out of her mouth
Did captain marvel punch a old women 
like no shit, it's a teaser trailer for a movie that comes out next year, yall remember the infinity war trailer? Half of that stuff wasn't even in the movie. Same for Ragnarok. Stop being stupid.
the shook in that maybe ten seconds where you see Malekith (at least dark elves, idk if its really him), then carol hitting a grandma and after that a young coulson. Holy f*ck.
1:30 poor granny
Grandma: I think DC is better
1:30 she punch grandma
First a black then a Female. Let’s never use white men again lol
With comments like "A hero hits the old lady" we see how many fake geeks are here, lol Especially after Fury's words "A secret invasion", but yeah, totally, heroine just beats a poor granny! Not like she fights something atop of that same train, noooo, xD xD
If you pause at the moment she hits the grandma. And go frame by frame. You can see that she doesn't even hit the grandma. Idk why I'm that deep.
Marvel fans hit like 😎
Another retard3d shithole of a movie from Marvel..how fuckin' awesome.
Holly shit..wow
I hope Stan Lee doesnt cameo as a Skrull... Captain Marvel is gonna TKO the old timer
Nothing about it excites me for some reason and I dig the comic book movies. She's not that interesting of a lead, sorry, and bringing back that ruined Ronan character annoys me. Ronan is not a six four white guy, he is supposed to be as big or bigger than the Hulk. He looks idiotic in that get up. Maybe the Skrulls can save the movie but meh
Hit like if you think it's disappointing 😑😑😑...
1:30 God what did the nice old lady do!!
When Grandma doens't buy you food
Should have just named it Ms Marvel like the original comic books because this shit looks bland af
It seems that people are still not bored of this superhero bullshit.
1:30 now we know why she wasn't there for all those years.  She got inprisioned for punching that old woman's jaw off who turned out to not be a skrull.
Supposedly the savior Avenger yet can't throw a proper punch. This damn movie better not disappoint
People that are reacting on captain marvel punching a nice old lady are the ones who don't read the comics
I just saw a young Nick Fury AND Phil Coulson.... Yep I'm sold.
1:31 Nothing like good old elder abuse
My wife says I shouldn't feel old, but with each passing day she's wronger and wronger.
Literally all the comments are about her punching the old lady
Yeah you better thank the bus driver old ladies, otherwise Captain Marvel is gonna get you...
Old lady: with who
When your grandma forgets pizza rolls
Why’d she punch the old lady for?
More comic movies for fat 30+ year old virgins living in their mother's basement.
another shit movie with stupid jokes that probably is gonna like to all the people
Yeah i know this trailer is great and all but why did she punch an innocent grandma at 1:31
That old lady must be a skrull.
I want to know why she smacks that old lady I really do
Thet old lady got slapped into the dc universe
Nice sucker punch lmao
Did she just punch a little old lady?!
Is this the chick who said she hates white men?
Then Carol socks an old lady. Wonderful
Shit that's why marvel is the best, cause they make insane movie, damn im so hyped for this movie
Will We Be Able To Watch This Before Mars hit the Earth?
Theory: That old woman she punches isnt even a skrull she just took her damn seat
Why did she punch an old lady ?
Captain Marvel, some bullshit , in cinemas now
1:31 When grandma offers you a cookie box but inside are just knitting kits.
The old lady problem evil in disguise. That's why she punched her. Never judge just from seeing the trailer. Can't wait for this.
Me: This good shit.
That shit hyped me up
My favorite part was when she punched the old lady! Ok that sounds wrong...it's my favorite part because it probably isn't even an old lady but a skrull pretending to be an old lady..ok that sounds better.
Punches granny in the face. Yep, I'm gonna go see this movie.
I have a theory that Captian Marvel will continuously beat that old lady in front of Thanos till he feels bad for her and gives up the gauntlet. The after credits scene will show Thanos falling in love with the old lady only to realize that she's been dead for the past 8 hours.
REALLY want the context for her punching an old lady, though.
I will be really disappointed if that old lady turns out to be a Skrull. MY hero would gladly punch annoying old ladies.
Why did captial marvel clap her grandma
Aw shit,another. Passed off lesbian on the loose
1:30. I think she hit a skrull
1:31 she smacks a old lady what the heck
Granny ran her mouth and captain marvel wasn't having that shit.People get tense when they have to ride a bus.
1:31 Captain Marvel punches DC!!!!!!
that scene with punching old lady is awful, without context at least. Marvel - FAIL! the whole trailer looks like a B-class movie, I had huge hopes for it :((
Are you guys all perfectionists, If not just shut up and talk this shit after seeing the movie
I like how she randomly hits a granny on a train.
that grandma getting rekt is gonna be a new meme i know
How many iterations of this shitty character do we actually need? You've tried re-booting captain marvel how many times now? And you still keep doing it. I wouldn't be surprised if they  tried to introduce squirrel girl in this film. LMAO looks like its Lucas films turn to take a break and for Marvel to now burn
I think she hit the granny because she was a secret skrull
Honestly, this looks like shit
Hold my beer
Plot twist the old lady is thanos
She just punched an elderly woman.
Imagine if the grandma wasn't a skrull...
Plot twist: that grandma wasn't a skrull
What makes a hero -> hitting an old lady on her face...
Just one thing is really stupid... her nick name... Captain Marvel... WTF? Who gave to the hero that terrible name... 10y/o kid? Captain America was also, but Okay. Propaganda and the thing with cold war. Okay. But Captain Marvel? Embarrassing cliche...who will be next? Captain Bioraw for vegans and hipsters fans? Or Captain Woman for femimists or Captain Patriot Truck for all that rednecks outside?
Yo now I wanna punch an old lady
Who else is waiting for the END CREDITS?. Hit like.
I can't believe she punched an old lady in the face
Aye she punched tf out that old lady😂 1:32
Poor grandma 😂😂
Every DC producer, director, actor, shareholder and crew member needs to accept their fate from their Marvel overlords.
Ow shit! She turn me on... Marvelous!
Captain marvel is shit
Poor grandma!!!
Oh shit it's in the past
1:30 The tables have turned, Grandma!
This is  Bob. He is 0 years old.
Lol she just gonna be like smack to thanos in avengers 4 like she did that old lady rip thanos
*63k dislikes r all the old ladies around the world*
What? I won't punch an old lady. Come on.
YOOOO She legit punched that old lady in her face!!!! lol
You know it a 90;s set movie the second you see a blockbuster, best way they could convey in the first 30 seconds hey this doesn't take place today.  and the old lady is a skrull we all know this right.
A new shit will be coming in 2019
What the hell was that she beat than grandma
Great job Marvel you could've got that woman to be poc muslim transhender lesbian refugee but you literally had to have a white woman.
Reaaaaally not sure why they left the punching the old lady thing in the trailer
I hope she punches Thanos like she did that grandma.
Bro she really sock the shit out of the old lady 😭😭
Shit, this mental picture of an old woman being bludgeoned.....is now etched in my mind forever.....
Did she just punch an old lady at 1:30???
Did she just punched that Lola?
"oh shit..."
I'm betting this: She was human Carol Danvers and an airforce pilot, while piloting a jet however she crashed into and merged with Captain Mar-Vell and his memories overwrote hers. Now when she comes back to Earth to investigate Skrull activity her old memories start to trigger.
DC is the old lady Captain Marvel is punching
Wait.. Did she really just punch an old lady?
when she punched the grandma it was probably one of the skrulls shapeshifted into a less suspicious form
So we're just out here punching old ladies now?
i feel bad for the granny 1:31
1:32 what the granny do 😕 did not know a granny smiling  is a threat lol 😂
Movie's gonna be lit cuz granny took a hit \m/
White girl in a black men car. Something is wrong, she’s definitely an alien!
The mcu is done for sure now, why when the chitauri came did nick not call captaingenderstudies over here ? Why did he choose to run up on deck with a rocketlauncher?? Why when thanos first arrived did he not call her right away?? You peeps reallly believe the mcu was planned out??? Maybe? By a 5 year old. There was no need to put no goddamn team together. E tu marvel ??
who the heck is that old lady 1:31 his so poor to punch
There is no reason to punch an old lady.
Grandma punching scene 10/10 will watch again
your grandma watched this
Hit like if you think she gonna destroy THANOS 😎
Ok just saying, I know the film will probably turn her around and give it reason, but after she hit the old lady I really couldn't like her
Wow captain marvel punching old people? What a great way to debut in your movie
LMFAO dude she just coldclock an old ass woman? LOOLOOL
Hit like here ❤❤❤
ohhh i am sad about that old lady
I wanna watch it just to see why the Granny got punched lmao
The old lady must be Skrull,
Punches old ladies? My kind of superhero. Old ladies are the scum of the earth.
Weird, I thought this was a trailer for a Marvel movie, but it seems to be an advertisement for orchestra hits.
For expectation generated: worst trailer ever. that superhero doesn´t attract, it´s dull, gray and boring, like musicians say: it has no punch.
_Me_ - oh a blockbuster store , well the movie's gonna have a hella 90s reference shit
Great trailer! Cant wait to see her kick the shit out of thanos
Y'all stupid if you think that's just an innocent old lady that she just punched lmao
When she punch an old lady i was just 😨😨😨😨 and yea maybe she's a skrull. But damnn she is a real badass
When she punched that old woman I was like " OHHH SHIT" lmao
Old lady:Ha i got the seat before you!
As funny as that scene with her punching the shirt out of grandma 😂😂😂...but we all know it was a skrull but damn that's punch!!!
"What makes a hero" Cut to her punching a 90-year-old lady in the face :D
She punches old ladies, I'm on board
Did she just punch an old lady?! Why?!
*punches random old lady*
Y’all need to read the comics there’s these things called skrulls and they can shape-shift to look like humans = Carol punching grandma.
Not hating, she can run good, but she punch like a girl.. just sayin’
I made a shitty parody of this
The grandma actually is Loki.. captain Marvel's ex boyfriend 😂

Did u guys noticed in the trailer she just punched an old woman how mean?? 😠😠
I will be watching you marvel. If this turns out to be some "woke" shit, my wallet will take its revenge. Don't screw up the MCU.
Old lady : Iam martha.
I hope there's no shitty jokes in this one
I don't blame her for hitting that old lady, as a great man once said the hardest choices require the strongest wills.
1:30 when grandma does not want to take her meds
Grandma villan😂
Thor saw the trailer he's going to ask for her help in avengers 4 because she is supposedly stronger than Hela, which I think is bullshit but at least she's on the good side 😁😁
I think Captain Marvel really hates person who has wrinkly face just like the old woman she punched because the Skulls have wrinkly faces so that's why she punched the old woman but she didn't meant to punch the old woman or maybe she punched the old woman because Captain Marvel scan and observe her closely
Old lady:👌
Why did she punch an old lady how rude
1:31 when grandma makes raisin cookies instead of chocolate chip
*Punches old lady in face*
If I knew this trailer was coming out today i would  have worn my white pants.
Just in case some of y’all don’t know, that’s a Skrull disguised as an old lady. :p
She punched a grandma I hater her now jk
Uggghhhh its gunna suck,now the prequels come into play,why camt writers amd directors EVEEEEEERRRRRRR get there shit right
damn bro who knew all this time that thanos was the grandma
Thanos is gonna have to pop a cold one open and watch that sunset a little bit longer cuz it’s gonna be a while!
Another 33%: Grandma jokes
Captain Marvel : I punch an old lady in a train , because she doesnt have ticket
haw she punched that grandma, marvel going evil. the company that is
Holy shit. THAT LOOKS SO FRIKKING SWEET!!!!!
Do people ACTUALLY have a problem with the beautiful granny punch?
Just imagine her saying in her little voice "I'm going to punch you Thanos" 🙄🤣
I Can Keep Going And Not Stop But Seem's To Me Like Women Need All Of This To Feel Good About Their Selve's That's Why Marvel Studio's And Many Other's Are Making Movie's To Inspire Women Yeah Women Need This Otherwise They Might Die Thinking World Is Of Men And It's Ok I Get It Women Actually Really Need This I Understand Good Job Marvel Studio's Uffff Someone Please Shoot Me Lol's "Captain Marvel" For God Sake Did This Really Had To Happen Man Please Understand This Not Every Super Hero Need's A Super-heroine Or A  Female Gender Please Stop Being Full Of Shit Because I Know Very well Wolverina Is Coming Soon Also Just Like Captain America/Marvel I Mean The Ending Of Wolverine Made It Very Very Clear Now Please Don't Kill Spiderman  Atleast Lol's
Maybe Captain Marvel is MCU and the old lady is DCEU
In 1:31, did she just smash a grandma? Who might she be?
Grandma: I like DC characters better
Did Captain Marvel just clock an old lady in the face?
She fell from sky, she walked, she turned, she talks, she stands, she falls, she keeps having memories. She has an existential crisis. Except for that one punch there is nothing badass or remotely exciting about this trailer.
She punched an old woman
This trailer was poor. They at least could have showed the old lady turning into a skrull. Marvel makes too much money, this will be their downfall. Maybe dc will thrive.
Me : I know... you punched an old lady.
0:08 suddenly I feel old
I wanna see Ronin! Pretty sure that old lady that she punched is a skrull.
Anybody notice she hit a old lady
the old lady is a scrull of course
Punching old ladies? Okay Marvel
Are we going to see the Captain  Marvel as an old woman(like Peggy Carter) in Avengers 4? Just asking!
The superhero that punches old ladies, I like it. 1:30
I love the retro style of the movie, blockbuster, old cars, the streets, I'm hyped.
This shit looks weak,Iron man 1 is still the best comic book movie ever made,and i fuckin hate iron man lol
She really slapped that old lady
Dudeeeeeee, she totally suckered punch that Gma O_O Lol 
That old lady said  FEMENISIM is part of LGBT
Also, she more than likely punched the old lady because the lady was a Skrull
Already know the plot. Shitty trailers.
I think this is the worst marvel trailer i've seen,  its i think because marvel told not much about it, in this trailer. I thought that in the end of this trailer, that we see a sneek peek of avengers infinity war but...
In all honesty, after the events of Infinity War, who gives a flying shit what happened years before with any character let alone Ms Marvel? I know I don’t. This is like the walking dead. Just leaving cliffhangers for long periods of time but this isn’t TV and I would argue it doesn’t make “Good TV” so why do it here? What a dick move. I will not be attending this movie. I wouldn’t even pirate you.
Did she just punched an old lady ?
another crap movie that will be hit cx main character is a woman
So does punching a grandma make me a hero?
I will watch this movie just so I can see the whole scene of Brie Larson punching an old lady. I just...I have to see how it escalated to that.
Heroes are measured by how hard they hit your grandma 😂😂😂
1:32 Did she just punch an old lady?
I feel the need ...the need ...for punching an old lady on a train
The old lady she punched was Thanos' granny. That's what started this whole mess.
Isn’t this the chick that hates straight white dudes?
Captain Marvel: told u that I would come and beat your as

Gotta be honest....trailer looks like shit
Why did she punch an old lady
the old lady is a Skrull
She punched that old lady because she wanted her seat
Also people do not complain or criticize about the trailer we all know your excited to watch the movie and cry. marvel always makes good movies and they always surprise us like the Granny.
Brie Lawson is getting too old.
*Punches old lady in the face* 
The old woman is a skrull
The green lantern of Marvel hitting old people. Yup
Marvel Studios: Alright, we have to introduce Captain Marvel to the audience but cut the budget for the next Avengers movie... Alright then. Put some fight scenes but use less visual effects. "punches grandma"
He Punch a grandma??
Hope it doesn't suck, but I'm not really scared because Marvel's been hitting the nail on the head lately.
Grandma Rest in Peace :D
Why did she punch an old woman?
1:30 shes cracks an old lady.
Is anyone going to take into account that she hit an elderly woman😂
1:31 when your Asian Grandma keep asking what day it's
Anyone know the name of the music video when there is a young couple moving in together and they grow old together and then die and a new younger couple moves in . Please if you know what song it is please tell me please
The old lady is a villain/morpher
Her voice sounds so childish, like a ten year old is speaking. Looks meh, more excited for IW 2 and Spiderman Far from home.
Normally a trailer for a Marvel movie  is bold and sells itself...this is not one of those. Certain the movie will be a hit, but the trailer is just generic looking in terms of editing and look. In short, this is not selling Captain Marvel to me. And I read some of the comics. If you want to sell this movie, make it fun and wild. Not this brooding "a hero will rise" type because that has been done so many times. 
if thanos dresses like an old lady he's screwed
Can I get an F in the chat for grandma
Did she have to punch a geriatric tho lol
Skrull grandma!! Awwww shit I'm excited!!!! - brisce m
Did she Puch a old woman?
When grandma bakes raisin chocolate chip instead of chocolate chip.
What... That movie will be so a big boring shit... 100%
at 1:29 we finaly  see the skrulls, so i guess that woman she hits is a skrull. and yeah captain marvel is on hulk and thor's levell. and the first captain mar-vel was thanos' nemesis till mar-vel died of cancer. After thanos'return from death it became adam warlock. but why is it so bad that it's the newest captain marvel, she became superpowered by being exposed to his kree power annyway. and when she was binary  she was waayyy more powerfull so what's the big deal?
I’m still hype for this movie but disappointed with this trailer a little. And I really hope they explain why she’s punching old ladies on the train cause WTF Carol?
Smashes old lady.. savagery
Captain Marvel was a black woman (Monica Rambeau) before she was a white woman. She was even leader of the avengers. That was groundbreaking and then Marvel comics ended that in the worst way by injuring Monica.
that's for leaving me at the park grandma
Dr Strange went back time to warn Nick and her about the end game. Everyone turning to dust and all that then he disappeared. Nick was shocked and had Shield considered him AS A THREAT. In Captain America Winter Soldier,  they mentioned Stephen Strange as a threat to this Earth..... but he wasn't even Dr. Strange at that time. When Nick turns to dust, he remembered Dr. Strange. So he said, "Motherf-"
But why did she straight up beat Grandma's face in?
She gets possessed by a Negro spirit when she punches that old white woman !!
This is a look a like a shit 👌🏻
This honest to god looks like shit
old woman: punches back
Ok nerd talk.. the old lady she hit probably isn’t an old lady... if anything that was an alien(the kree) and they can shape shift and transform to look different so anyone in this movie can be a threat
11/10 for old lady punching
Magnetto beats all.  Everytime.  Also a a well places sniper in those trees during that last battle could have killed him...  shit anthrax could have killed him.
1:30 when grandma forgets to make sweet potato pie on Thanksgiving...
Hope the old ladies name was Martha.
1:31 when grandma says  MGK is better.
I see Coldson yesss
One Punch Woman
_What a retard3d shithole of a movie this will be._
Captain Marvel is apsolute shit.
1:31 OH shit xD
Dumb female actor...cant act for shit...looks like she ate a shit salad before acting ... the emotionless face.
She punch that grandma
It’s just getting old...
Why did she punch the old lady?
so what did the grandma do deserving that punch
What if this entire time we thought that old lady was a skrull  only to find out that was an actual old lady 💀💀💀
Somehow hitting a grandma make u a hero
**smacks tf outta a smiling 90 year old woman**
This is the downfall of Marvel. If it keeps pushing this shit agenda. I doubt Marvel's going to be any good after Avengers 4.
Lmao she punched the old lady
Hitting grannies was still accepted in the 90's
I hope she was just delusional and actually punched an old woman in the face.    I'm guessing it will be a Skrull or Doctor Minerva but oh well one can hope.
I was shook when she punch the hell out the old lady.
Take that old people
Plot twist: Grandma is not a skrull
You don't know why she punch that old lady
I hope that old lady was a skrull
Looks like an interesting new hero take for the MCU--tons of power, already present and in control, but mangled memories--so what to do with the power and who to trust are the questions for her.  I like that she seems unassuming, even a bit passive in places.  Woman's lost her memories.  It's appropriate for her to hold back and take everything in before acting.
Captain marvel knocking old bitches out! A true super hero!
Did she punched a grandma? Srsly....
I dont like cap tain marvel because she punch a old mama
She has no emotions and this movie is going to be the MCU's first flop. Good job Marvel! You continue to cater to SJPansy swine and it continues to backfire on you until you hit eventual bankruptcy. We'll have enough decency on our part to not tell you "we told you so" when it happens.
Why did she punched the old lady?!
So Captain Marvel punches a woman on the bus and is called a superhero, yet when I do it, suddenly there's a problem...
Still holding out for my boy Aquaman.
Same shit again and again.
Damn! Did she just punch someone's grandmother...
y’all know that old lady is a shapeshifting alien right
*Peter Parker punches MJ **_HARD_** in the face*
Why’d she punch dat woman
Captain Marvel Punching Aunt May 🤣
1:30  okay wait until 2019 to explain, that grandma issue
10/10 Would rewatch Grandma slap again
Can the internet go ahead and get to work with making captain marvel punching that grandma in the face, into the funniest meme of 2018 ? Somebody need to get started on that ASAP
This is shit, yes I am a DC fan suckers (not DCU)
crash landed to earth , punched an old lady , what else would she do
They told her she couldn't go to the beach, but she did it!
Was about to put that corny stamp on it but then .....she hit that old lady.
Is old lady died or what !?
This shit looks amazing. I love it. Not Infinity War levels, of course, and certainly not Thor Ragnarok or GoTG 2 levels, but close.
The old lady isn't a skrull, she make fun of Captain Marvel green suit, get beat up.
 P.S. I'm guessing that old lady was really a Skrull in disguise, if not then that's the funniest scene Marvel has put out.
I bet the real Captain Marvel(Shazam) movie will be better than this shit.
Let’s hope she thought the old lady was a skrull...
Idc if this gets 30 million. That doesnt mean this movie is going to be a hit. I cant describe the ending forsure but I know Captain Mary sue will help save the day. Superhero cliche type style. Marvel pulls in a hero last second and pushes out backstory just in time for that hero to save the day...smh.  fingers crossed though.
Anannii sikeyiiim tuylerim diken diken oldu
Old lady: Hi would you like some cookies I baked
Dont kill the grandma, plz
Young Fury and Coulson. I'm sold
im sad cuz we dont know shit about her and stuff and she will probbably be the strongest and main reason to defeat thanos, but i'd much rather see my old superheros to win on their own ):
This looks good, but I really can’t wait for captain marvel 2: granny’s revenge
0/10 she punches an old lady.
Who else laughed when she punched the old lady? 😂😂😂😂
Ok guys, shut up with that old lady. I gonna give you a spoiler. Captain Marvel got also apower to see seconds into the future. That old lady is a Skrull shape shifter who's gonna jump on her and wanna kill her seconds into the future. PERIOD
what did that old lady do to you???!?!? OMG
Please just crumple it all up and start over cause this was utter dog shit.
Ms. Marvel has a Superman problem - she's too powerful, and her core powers are boring. She has no unique gimmick (Dr Strange = Magic, Ironman = Tech, Spiderman = Webs +Agility, Hawkeye = Arrows, Ms. Marvel = Powerful???). Hopefully they make the story interesting, otherwise this is just gonna be Marvel's version of the Henry Cavil Superman movies - boring as hell with a mind-numbing amount of special effects in a desperate attempt to compensate. I'm afraid the battles will be nothing more than a shouting match, plus who can punch harder and who can shoot lasers "harder".
What did granny do?????? It really do be like that sometimes.
1:30 when u give an old person ur seat on the bus and they dont say thankyou
Yo, did she just punch a grandma?!
Looks like shit. I’m calling it now, Avengers 4 will be the end of good marvel movies. Plus this clearly takes place way before the rest of the MCU. She’s probably gonna look like Carl Manvers in the post credits scene.
How is no one talking about how she socked an old woman to the face?
Şehitler ölmez❤ 
Technically if this is placed in the 90's shouldn't she still be Carol Danvers aka Ms. Marvel. That was her name at that point in time "90's". She didnt become Captain Marvel until 2012 right? So she wouldnt be Captain Marvel in a movie set to take place in the 90's... I think thats what the green suit signifies. That she isnt Captain Marvel at that point. We only see her for a a few seconds in this video in her Captain Marvel red and blue suit. I think she doesnt gets that suit until Mar-Vel dies and she gets contacted by the Nick Fury from the future (post credits scene from Infiniti War I could set this up). I think once those two things happen and technically she has contact with the future (past 2012) then she will then become Captain Marvel. It takes both of those things to logically have her take up MarVel's mantle as Captain Marvel. Brie Larson playing Carol Danvers with MCU's production quality has the potential to be amazing. I honestly hope its done well though and not rushed. If she is to become Captain Marvel then make her earn it and pay the heroes burden. There is much more to being a hero and leader than being powerful. I hope the story is told well and we see Carol Danvers trials and tribulations that lead to her becoming Captain Marvel. I have a bad feeling that this is all happening to set up her take over of the Avengers and Capt. is gonna be killed off :( I just hope its not the case and that Captain Marvel is done right. Mostly I just hope this is all building up to Rogue taking her powers and the Xmen coming into the MCU :) Doubt it but one can hope x)
Tamil people Hit like
The granny that she punches in the face represents all the feminazis who forced Marvel to change her look now she's getting some backlash cuz she's pissed
Awesome trailer yay ♥️ please captain Marvel get hitched to captain America and make babies and name them AMERICAN MARVEL. LMAO 😁♥️
Punching an old lady 10/10
Punches Grandma.

Punches granny in the face

RIP grandma 1:31
omg i proud of my daughter 'cause she said she want to be a superhero and she already punch old woman in the face
Im predicting grandma memes in the future 🤔🔮
She just punched that old ass lady in the mouth 😂
Why is she punching Superman's mother? :P 
I want either Richard Spencer or Tomi Lahren’s face replacing that old lady as part of a meme
1:25 She low-key decked a granny in the face, so I'm betting it's a skrull.
this shit look good asaf.. cant wait for the rest of the trailers
If punching a grandma is hero material for her ,than I hate heroes,brie larson suck
Did she legit punch an old lady😱
1:30 that old lady explode after that punch lmao

Behold the greatness.
Wonder what that old lady did to piss off Brie Larson ask for her number 😉
Granny must be a Skrull.
why did she punched grandma!!!
It looks so dry and why couldn't they get someone younger to play captain marvel she looks old
I love how marvel showed the image of her punching an old lady to show that skulls are gonna be in the movie

Theres Dark elf, Ronan, Chitauri, Nova.
Skrull old lady.

holy shit!!!!!!!!!
can't wait for the old lady punch memes
1:31 when grandma says she’ll buy u what u want for your birthday but buys you socks
People complaining about being sexist about us wanting and knowing captain marvel IS A GUY is pretty wrong most of us grew up with the comics and cartoons of the old days, Ms. Marvel had an important role in the MCU alongside CM but sadly they just eliminated one of the best roles of all time.
She punched old woman..what captain?!
So i can punch a Skrull that pretends to be an old lady and i can be a hero!!!
Captain Marvel: (smacks Grandma to another universe)
Punching Grandmas!
she punch the old lady......it is a Disney movie, right?
Can we get a f in the chat for poor grandma😂😂😂😂1:30
1:30 Poor Granny.
Grandma: harder
I want thanos to shit on them, honestly.
Plot twist : Grandma is captain marvel
I think some of yall hit your heads lol. This movie will be great and be strong glue for the entire MCU especially infinity war!
I’m really rooting for captain marvel to be an absolute master piece, but I’m not sold on the trailer. I know the trailer is trailer for a reason and that’s to show   a small portion of the movie. From what I saw in the trailer nothing struck me with the wow factor, I do hope it’s an awesome movie though.
When your grandma says she dosen't like superhero movies.
She just punched grandma at 1:31 0.0.... i like her already :)
I think that old lady is the mother of thanos😂😂
How old can he get?
The grandma is a skrull I presume
*punches the old lady
Who is scrolling in the comments while watching the trailer and see lots of comments about that grandma being punched in the face by Captain Marvel?
1:30 The old lady likely said she was going to vote for trump again.
Granny nooooo ;_;
When your Grandma won't stop trying to feed you. 1:31
Looks surprisingly shit
Holy shit balls, I can't wait!
So she's an Alien that beats up old ladies?
Ps: That old lady was a shape shifting skrull(maybe😬).
1:33 Oh shit its a young Agent Phil Coulsen
We got One Punch Man Season 2.
Also I heard it was very well received in the test screening just like The Winter Soldier.
Captain Marvel is going to be big hit.
WHAT MAKES HER... *Jacks an old lady in the face...
Trailer looks like shit wtf
Punching oldies for some reason is TIGHT!
Old lady: Do you ever smile Brie Larson? What.. don't hit me...
Did she just punch an old lady in the face
Looks womp-womp. I just liked the part when she punched the old lady. EDGELORD AF.
1:30-She punched a granny in the face
Seeing Captain Marvel punch an old woman who was smiling at her without context was hilarious. 
Captain marvel, punching old women from 1980s..
im sad to say this but this looks like shit
Umm that old lady she punched was a Skrull right?
She's a scrull granny
Yes Captain Marvel will Appeared to bring Back Dr Strange, Bucky Burnes, Wankanda Soldiers, Black Panther, The Vision, Scarlet Witch, Spider Man, Star Lord, Garmora, Mantis, Drax, and Groot to Defeat Thanos in Avengers infinity War part 2
Heck yeah. Punch that grandma. Punch her hard.
*hits grandma*
I’m favourite part of the trailer is when she punched that skrull I’m tired I’m going to go back to sleep
Shit, It looks really good. I can’t wait!!!
Holy shit , Im so ready for more heartbreaks
Indian fans hit like

When grandma doesn’t bake you cookies 1:30
*insert punching grandma joke*
That poor old lady 😳😬
She sucker punched that old lady lol
why she gotta do the grandma like that?
Don’t trip guys that old woman was obviously a skrull.
Apart from punch to the old lady everything is boring & looks same old story telling
Did anyone see her punching an oldy lady XD
I'm saying she's a bully. Why did she have to punch that nice little old grandma on the bus? Grandma took the bus all the way to the supermarket miles away to go get some brownie mix, so that she could make her grandbabies some damn brownies for their afterschool snack and this beotchie delivers the smackith downith. Why? Someone please answer me. Why? Cause grandma had some 1980's coke bottle glasses that she did not like or because grandma wouldn't give up her seat and she wanted it so badly because she was tired after a long day of hanging out with Fury and fighting the baddies. Not cool Captain Marvel. Not Cool at MF ALL. You have just become Captain Meanie/Captain Senior Citizen Basher in my book and no one will convince me other wise. Punk Beotch.
10 seconds in and I already hit pause and went straight to comments.
Why would you punch that nice old lady >:d
But that trailer was shit.
Hope My Prince from Wakanda gonna do some Epic Comeback shit soon.. Because it's still *To Soon..*
Like because of the balls they had to show her hitting an old lady.
Eeeey Disney Hitting The Grandma’s
Before any big shit will happen in this movie, i got a question: Where will be any previous marvel hero when this shit will happen?
Beating up and old lady, hmph. I thought DC and Marvel were completely different
She hits old lady because age is just damage like anything else. It has to do with an omission of information that should have been taught a long time ago. It's that captors here have had omitted that information so that we will die faster. It's a system of control. 
"Discover what makes her a hero." Punching old ladies? I know, the old lady is probably a shapeshifter, but really? Punching old ladies right after that? I will say the "her" into "hero" was kind of clever, but I'm not forgetting her punching an old lady. How many superheros have done that?
1:30 If that was a Skrull, than using his/her shapeshifting powers to disguise him/herself as an old lady is low.
Gynowashing established male archetypal characters from popular culture, thereby adopting stylized masculine traits and behaviors as feminine ideals, isn't only as bad as all other types of cultural appropriation, blackface traditions and Hollywood's habit of whitewashing characters originally conceived as other ethnicities, it's even worse as it posits a role model for girls and young women that most adult women would find radically conflicting with their temperament and emotional preferences if they ever tried adopting it... You may not agree with this now, but you will eventually. Many people also enjoyed seeing blackface musicians in the era of the minstrel plays and didn't see anything wrong with it.
Would've saved so much money if you didn't make this bullshit and released shazam early.
Im sorry did she just oof a granny. oh my dayz
When you get another sweater for Christmas from your Grandma 1:30
Did she just punch an old woman in the face?
why she punch old lady.. ruude
She punched an old lady in the face! Is this what a super hero is now punching old ladies in the face
*This trailer kinda feels like  Ryan Renolds Green   Lantern  to me  .........*
Captain marvel: punches old lady.  No one wants your rasin patmeal cookies
The Old lady deserved it
Captain marvels blonde headed white girl? Fknme
Would you punch your grandma for 8,000,000,000?
I wonder who the token white guy will be in this one?
Anyone gunna say anything about how she just sucker punched that old lady 1:31
its shit and boring like
Me: Alright thanks grandma!
old lady was a skrull
Hit a million likes plzs
Grandma: you're next.
Granny: What?
She socked that SH*T out of that old lady.
Holy shit.... this is pretty darn awesome 🔥😎🎬👌👏👍 Can't freaking wait for this 🎬
Zzzz...another stupid blonde protagonist ..enough super hero bullshit ...
I love it when she punches the grandma😊🍿
God u guys are stupid people who did  not read the comics grandma was a skrull
Punching grandmas like the good all days
Salty DC fanboys trying to talk shit about how bad this trailer is, remember BvS and Suicide Squad trailers?? Lmao
Marvel fans hit like 🔥 🔥
So... who's the enemy? An old lady?
First thing I see is a Block Buster and I feel old.
I love marvel... but this trailer was kind of shit. Also I have zero problem with a female lead, but I really dislike this actress.
Wow how original. "Magic Negro and Equal Girl"....total dog shit.
1:30 holy shit lmao
So since marvel showed us that a grandma is getting punched does that mean in other up coming movies the same will happen?????hmmm?????
Let's see that the old lady scene(she was a skrull tho don't worry) turns a meme in just couple of days, maybe hours lmao
The moment when Captain Marvel has white eyes and Batman doesn't...
Everyone is freaking out about Captain Marvel, and I’m just sitting here like holy shit, 0:07 it’s a blockbuster!
Grandma smiles & gets punch like DDDAAAMMMNNN🤛 Captain Marvel please kick THANOS BARNIE looking butt please!!.
'A hero' . Then seen punching an old woman
Everybody wants to know she not kicked the old lady it's alein it's transform to escape from Captain Marvel 😂😂😂
1:30 *Slaps Old Lady*
End of Old Lady
She stole the shit outta that skrull lady lmfaoo 👊
Well atleast they are getting some use out of the old blockbuster stores
She hit an old lady.
When your grandma tells you to go to sleep at 10 PM on the weekends; 1:30
So we just punchin' old ladies now? First you take out my boys Peter and T'Challa, and now this? C'mon Marvel...
the old lady said "SHAZAM WAS THE REAL CAPTAIN MARVEL"
1:30 when i heard about Captain Marvel was gonna Get a movie i was like f***k this shit
1:31 when grandma says there's no dessert
I should know to trust Marvel, but there is absolutely nothing here that makes me feel like spending ten bucks to watch it. Hope I'm wrong, but this looks generic and boring as shit.
I'd like to put this out there. I realize that the trailer may be sub-par to the others Marvel has made. I felt the same way. But lets remember this. She obviously can't recall her past life and her true personality. She knows shes on a mission. She socks a grandma clearly saying to me she knows the Skrull are on Earth. She is known to be a HARD ASS taking NO shit kind of girl bad ass bitch. She doesn't play games. Last but not least, have faith. There will be other trailers and clips released and has Marvel really ever let us down hard?? I can't remember any time.
I'd watch the movie just to find out why that smiling grandma deserved to be punched out.
1:30 Bloody Old Women
This shit looks too serious
Groups against abusing the elderly are already calling out this trailer for that old lady scene. 😝
Finally!!!!! Not the typical origin movie by the looks of it. I guess this will be more focused on why she is a superhero than on how she became a superhero. Congratulations to Marvel Studios for breaking the superhero origins mold, another stroke of genius!
Wait did she just hit a old lady ahahaha
looks shit. but id still watch
Punches an old lady
Coulson looks older in the 90s than now. They have to fix that CGI.
She punched an old lady lol.
Wait. She just punched an elderly.
i feel bad for the grandma 😥
This trailer.. was not good, I told people a character that no one likes to begin with becuz she basically doesn’t have a good character would not be properly portrayed on screen just becuz of how rooted her character is. To the Core she’s literally a power egotrip Nazi who believes she does no wrong, don’t believe me? Look her up in the comics lol and also just know and remember this comment for the next infinity war movie, she’s gonna be the downfall of captain America unless they’re gonna change it up or something but SHE will be the person with the least bit of any heroism and charisma. Think of a person u always tell funny jokes to and doesn’t laugh. And you’ll get her, then add Spider-Man into a room with her as he talks to her. That’s how awkward you’re gonna feel XD
Why did she punch the old woman😢?
I Love The Scene Where She Punches The Grandma.... Lol😂😂😂
absolutely! SKRULLS! finally. Marvel is hitting on all cylinders - DC, not so much!
granny 0 - captain 1
The kree old lady shape shifter.
When grandma doesn’t give you a Christmas gift 1:30
Not interested in captain marvel shit
1:30 when grandma burns the cookies
And why was the old lady smiling, was it to attract a punch?
Y’all keep asking “how are you a hero for punching an old lady in the face?” But any real marvel fan with basic knowledge knows that was definitely a shapeshifting skrull.
Captain marvel wants money from grandma
I like when old ladies 👵 get punched it speaks to me
Meh! doesn't cause my member to throb. Yeah, she's the savior in finty' sequel.  What is the threat that makes the film, compelling, it doesn't seem like the script based I what I just saw? What's the threat? Thanos? Whoopi Goldberg? Joe Biden?
Good for her for punching an old lady. XD
I'm not sold..
1:31 when your grandma says shes finer than you
Who is older.... Captain America or Captain Marvel
Thor is better than captain marvel, hit like if u agree
Why are people asking why she punched the old lady? It’s because she’s a scroll. And I am so excited for this!!!
Why did she just straight up slump that old woman like that??
oh...shit i am late
*punches an old lady*
That’s just the old lady from spongebob, she said she ain’t want none of your chocolate and you hit her 😱
Looks like Tahiti did Phil some good.
Enough of this super hero bullshit. Youve milked it enough! This is getting cringey
My one fear is found in the next Avengers; I want her to *help defeat Thanos,* but I don't want her to be *the reason they win.* It'd feel cheap, bringing in a new uber-powerful character to defeat the villain. I hope that she gets Thanos into the final showdown (with some assistance, maybe, but likely unrequired) and the final showdown is with the full Avengers, the ones left, or just the founders. I have *no doubt she'd be the most powerful one,* the only challenger being Thor w/ Stormbreaker (or Hulk if he gets his shit together and gets pissed/ comic Hulk), but I don't want them to abuse that in the movie.
*Watches how she smash the shit out of an oldwoman*
No hype, look like total bullshit
So basicly cool women vs white supremacist plot again ? Star wars flashes all over again :-O idk idk
1:30 wait did she just punch an old lady on the train?
All it took was the Granny punch, and now I'm interested in what this movie will deliver.
Another feminist propaganda film sold by Disney just like Zootopia, Beauty and the Beast 2017, and Star Wars.
Anyone else think she looks like the weird white girl from orange is the new black??
1:30 Grandma confirmed new villain.
Cpt Marvel so powerful, she punches grandmas😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 (yes ik what it is)
That old lady got rekt
Is that seriously the voice she is going with? Why does she sound like a 5 year old? I so wanted her to be the bad ass she looks like.  Grrrrr
Captain marvel: *Punches the old lady in the freaking face*
The deal breaker was when she hit the grandma. AND SHE WAS SMILING JUST TO GET A WHACK IN THE FACE.
This is everything I asked for.. And more...got to see fury coulson. Her green suit.. Red and gold suit.. Even her mohawk suit.. Cant wait for 2019 to come..
All super hero'd out. How many more super heros do we really need? plus the feminist bs. nothing worth watching anymore, same old shit, different day. No imagination in this generation, same boring song and dance......
what skrull would take the place of a old lady
Really. She punch that fuckin grandma
Guys come on... The old lady being punched is probably a skrull, you know, the main villains of the movie?
No offense marvel but this looks like garbage, I know I’m gonna get hate but it looks like one of those shit Netflix shows 🤷‍♂️
She punched that old lady...
Why she punched that old woman ?😝🤒
ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  although i did watch her punch the old lady like 3 or 4 times
F.Y.I for some of you it's time to wake up. This movie is a good way to show what cyborgs & beings also from the future are all about. Some of us are from this planet or dimension & some are definitely not. I'm excited about scanning this movie when its street date. I'm a new wannabe fan no doubt. This movie will hit home for some of us & some may get triggered in some way.👽💫🤖
Just one reaction.....Holy shit!
People talking shit before they even see the movie....typical idiots.
I have to admit this trailer is more shitty then last Jedi. Hopefully, the movie will change my mind.
Damn TF she punch the old lady for
Would he a good introduction/teaser to The X-Men and reason why she's never made an appearence all this time. Plus generally never liked her as a character and find Rogue absorbing her powers and putting her in the coma my favorite part of her story. For those who don't know, Captain Marvel isn't a very liked comic book character in general and those who defend her are generally fans of her older appearences back from when she was Miss Marvel or just people who never read a comic book and watched some other media.
The way she punched that old lady huhuhu
Most epic moment? Captin marvel punches a old women in face...
The old lady she punched is a villain?
I have graced this trailer by appearing before this hits 30M
This movie doesn’t really make sense in the MCU considering what Nick Fury told Thor in Avengers:
1 like = 1 RIP for that old lady
Why'd she punch grandma?
1:31 when u cant take it anymore cuz ur grandma keep forcing u to eat
Im sure instead of a decent superhero movie, this will be 2 hours of femenist lecture bullshit. No thanks.
Did she just punch an old lady in the face .-.
it makes me laugh that they say that Brie is a bad actress when she has 1 Oscar and 1 golden globe
It will hit infinty war
I like how she decks that old lady. But why though? 😂
Have you ever wanted to Doomfist so hard you punched an old lady in the face?
I just love the bit where she punches an old lady. I cannot believe that they put that in a trailer where most of the people watching won't know what a freaking Skrull is.
She punched the shit out of the grandma.
looks pretty shit to be honest. tried to hard to push a female lead and its looking like we got a green lantern remake.
This hero like shit man , i don't like it ?
Did she just hit an old lady?
Supwr massive hit like 1m
Am I the only one who was hit with crippling nostalgia when they showed the Blockbuster HomeVideo Store?
the old an loved block buster
Come on the old ladies obviously a skrull
This movie looks so shit
all the feminist "hero" can do -> punch elderly lady. yet another strong "female leading character".
In a world where old women believe they can sit on any seat they want, one woman will show them that they can't! Introducing Captain Marvel...all will fall, and they will not get up.
*Your friend, Captain Marvel, was kicked from the server for slapping an old woman in the face*
I would watch this movie just to know why she punched the old lady.
Tbh I don’t know what to think in my opinion it was very weird and just felt off to me but I trust in marvel they always do good in their films so yeah until we get more I’m saying the trailer was (shit? ) idk what’s the word for it u know
Why she is white? Is it politically correct to ultimate hero (captain MARVEL) be not from any minority?
Show me.adam warlock!!! They put him in gaurdians of the galaxy as a teaser.  Now theyve shown thanos, adam warlock, and captain marvel, some crazy shit is gonna happen
Just thinking here,I see people talking of how she could be the one to defeat Thanos... I don't think it'll be her,I believe she'll just help Tony defeat him... Which is why doctor strange told thanos to spare him though he had already told him he would defend the time stone and let Tony die
Oh god, here we go. You can clearly tell they are gonna push the feminist bullshit into overdrive on this one.
Did she just punch that old lady that smiled at her?
*Plot Twist the old lady 👵🏻 is not a Skrull*
In the opening scene, how does one survive after free fall from orbit then hitting a store at ground level?
Maybe the old lady is in disguise and she is somebody bad in hiding???
0:51 Isn't he the same guy that did Chalkie White's muscle at Boardwalk Empire?
1) Brie Larson didn’t ruin Captain Marvel because of “bad acting”. Her mind was erased so she’s literally emotionless. 2) The old lady was a skrull, a shape shifting alien. 3) This movie is going to be amazing
Just summon Saitama he will one punch thanos straight to hell !!! 😂😂
Did she just slap the hell out of that grandma? God.
The most powerful figure in the MCU. Give me a break. No one cares about captain marvel. Thor would one punch this hoe.
*Grandma left the chat*
*Hits old lady on train*
At 1:30 ☺old woman is actually thanos👣👣. And as captain marvel has watched infinity war....She *aimed for the head*
Also I love that it starts out with her crashing into a BLOCKBUSTER! Thats straight up Saturday morning cartoon shit right there, I love that! :D
*1:30* is when my grandma caught a mean one to the face
Hope they don't blame "white man" if it fails
You can really tell who has read the comics and who hasn't going through these comments. So many times I was internally screaming because of what I saw. No Captain Marvel isn't a good ball of happy go lucky but she does have a few moments where she loosens up. And if you couldn't tell this movie is going to have "funny moments" that most mcu fans are use to when she punched an elderly woman in the face.... Actually she might think that old lady was a Skrull.
Why you hit your grandma kid 😂😂
When you ask your grandma what her favourite Marvel character is and she says Batman
Disliked it cause she punch a old lady
Wait did she punch a old lady lmao 😂😂😂
Take that, old lady!!!
that skrull chose a old lady ROFL
Hits a senior citizen. :(
I bet that grandma called her flat, so captain marvel got pissed and punched her
White women are the best
Grandma turns out to be aunt May
She punched Betty White. I'm boycotting.
Old wine in new bottle
I cannot WAIT to see all the Grandma punching memes that'll no doubt be created!
Skrulls ronan captian marvel slapping a old women and blockbuster take my money
She decked tf out of that old lady, jesus
1:31 grandma smiles innocently 
Grandma: Thanos did nothing wr-
1:32 ha got u drugdealer oh crap it's just an old woman well,I guess I have to go into hiding for 29 years
"A hero" a than she punch some granny...
I'm so fuckin jealous of Samuel L Jackson .  Always in big blockbuster movies even at his old age.  making millions and living the life! 😭😭😭😭
Yeah, the old lady is definitely just an old lady.  Great job putting 2 and 2 together everyone.  Impressive work, as always.  -_-
What's this shit?
Why does 90s Coulson look older than present day Coulson
Wait this is white washing why could they cast an actual intergalactic alien with powers. This is taking roles this super minority group.
Poor old lady. I'm boycotting.
Whoever is hating on captain marvel is cuz they don’t know shit about the character.
Damn that punch gotta hurt tho
She straight up punched that old lady in the face tf
She slap the old lady like a boss 😂😂😂😂
I hope her acting isn't as shit as it looks in this trailer
Did she just hit the old woman?
Waiting for Avengers 4...Hit like..👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
Why isn't Capt Marvel black??! Damn whitewashing in the movie industry!!!
Thats thanos in disguise as a grandma.
Why you got to punch that old lady though 1:30, no respect for elders nowadays .😁
Love punching old ladies.
how old is this theres a blockbusters
Punching that old lady
Grandma: So proud of Brie Larson for making the role!  She was amazing in ROOM
Fun fact from the set... A very jealous Brie Larson punched that old lady in the face because she could convey more expression than Brie...
That old lady is thanos..he changed reality. Lol
I honestly have no real problems with the trailer. I mean that scene where Carol punches an old lady definetly doesnt work without the context of her just being a skrull in disguise, but I can ignore that. Honestly I just don't really care about Captain Marvel in general. She is a character that Marvel has been trying to push forward for some odd reason and one I lost most of my respect for after Civil War II, though one could argue that event didn't do most of the characters any real justice. That's not to say that there isn't any potential here. Ant Man's films turned out great and they made the character a lot more interesting than he was before. I also don't like the idea of Captain Marvel being the central piece of the puzzle to save the world in Infinity War Part 2 instead of Adam Warlock. You know the guy Thanos respects the most in the comics, and also the protagonist of Infinity War in the comics? While it is possible that they won't suddenly make Carol Marvel's female equivalent of Superman, and that she'll just be great addition to the team, the way her reveal was handled in Infinity War sure worries me that they might try to give her a little to much protagonism in the next Avenger's film, though that's just speculation as of now. I'll still watch the movie in the hopes that Marvel won't give us a disappointing product, but we will just have to wait, and see.
I'm only interestred in why she punch that old lady
Captain marvel punching aunt may. Pedor gonna be pissed.
Is no one else talking about that granny getting hooked or?
Did anyone realise her smacking that old lady
* punches old lady *
HAH! Looks like shit
1:31 Plot twist. The old lady she punched, wasn't a Skrull.
1:31  She punched the taste out of that Skrull's mouth
I am not sold atm.
She punched an old lady I’m shook
"hold on to your butts"
They really hit us with the blockbusters in the beginning? Oh, the nostalgia😥
Her acting skills and personality are about on par with a corn riddled shit.
Grandma has to be a Skrull... or like, her actual grandma.
0:09 OMG BlockBuster I'd feel old
Ur grandma will not allow you to watch this movie..
She looks more powerful in the *COMICS* , in here she's just looks like a Green Power Ranger who punches old women.
I pray this wont be a feminist bullshit movie
I give this 10 out of 10 old ladies punched in the face.
Fun fact: The black female  pilot walking next to Carol around the minute mark is Maria Rambeau, mother of Monica Rambeau. Yes Marvel fans, go apeshit. Everyone else, carry on...
 “The animal(2001) “. Total shitty acting and just a pretty face.
Did she deck that grandma? I like this movie already
One of the few Marvel movie trailers with shitty trailer music. Doesn't get me into like some of the others.
Wow! That looks like a low buget crappy feminist shit!
Hey grandma here, just wanted to put this in my comment to get likes, thanks
She punched an old lady. *TRIGGERED*
Disney Marvel next big hit💲💵💱💰💰💰💰💵💱💲
The feminist are attacking old women. Somebody stop her! :D
She just smack that granny ??? 😂😂
this looks awful like it belongs on the CW also can Brie show any emotion at all she definitely doesnt looks like she wants to be in this shit movie.
Shit BlackWidow must be mad that Captain Marvel got a movie
And the Meme of the Year Award goes to: That Creepy Grandma from that Captain Marvel Trailer
Did she really just punch an old lady 😭
Hit a like if you are a fan of ironman
Dislike because she punched my grandma and she needed 69 surgery to repair her face😢
Son am I the only one that noticed grandma getting decked lmaooo foul bro.
Shit, I'm so excited
Rip 👵 Grandma she just wanted to make raisin cookies...
The only time my mouth went open was when she punched that old woman
Dammit, Grandma!!! I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO DRINK YOUR PRUNE JUICE!!!
why did she knock out that old lady 1:31
She punched the shit out of the old lady
So we just gonna ignore the fact she punched an old woman 😂
If a superhero punching a grandma expected to defeat Thanos excites you, I've got just the trailer for you!
she just punched an old lady 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is Brie Larson able to express emotions or is she made out of wax? What is the plot? Only noteworthy moment is her crashing into a blockbuster store and punching an old lady on the subway. Guess that's what we get from hollywood these days, not very exciting.
Yikes. Looks like a glorified CW show. Not buying this lady as a superhero. Plus, why is she beating that grandma? I'm out on this one.
More interested in seeing this for Ronan in his younger days. Something feels off about this teaser, typically you should be pumped for next full trailer or better yet the movie itself however I don't know how to feel it's just weird. Hopefully whatever they show next will be better than this grandma punching trailer
Granny is in train captain marvel have only 5 days but she hit granny and out of her .. Not house it is train
Oh Shhhhhittttttttt
im surprised by how much i enjoyed that. it was pretty dope. i mean dont make her be the 1 who kills thanos tho lol. but it looks like a pretty good movie. i like all of marvel and d.c shit but this 1 i was worried about. it surprised me. hats off captain marvel
Amazing trailer exited for this. Because I am reading the comics since I was 5years old
1:31 why u hit the old lady
When she punched the grandma 😂
So she's the secret weapon against Thanos, Do the Guardians of the Galaxy know about her? Are those Blue guys with Helmets the Kree? Are they good Where are the Skrulls? Why did the Kree erase her memory of her childhood of Earth? Was that old lady a Skrull? Is she going to do a better job at fighting the Skrulls than the Fantastic Four? Where were Mar Vell, Yon-Rogg, Ronan, Korath and the rest of the Star Force? Are the Star Force more powerful than the Nova Corps? Agent Phil Coulson is back on the big screen. She's the third Superhero after Captain America and the Original Ant-Man and the Wasp. Is Captain Marvel's job is to make sure that nobody on Earth gets caught in the crossfire in the Kree-Skrull War? Who's side will Captain Marvel choose between the Humans and the Kree but both their enemies are the Skrulls? Are we going to see Super Skrull and the Fantastic Four in the MCU and Will there be Secret Wars in the MCU?
did she just punch a old lady？😂
So.. A true hero is made by punching old womans? Lol
Marvel is now thinking that whatever they show it will go hit in the audience but to be honest this movie will not disappoint you like DC films,but aquaman n shazam r looking awesome.
Punches the hell out of a elderly women
Wait did she just punch an old lady
*99%*   of the people will watch, because of grandma
Part of me didn’t want this random chick to come out of nowhere and save the avengers but seeing her punch an old lady made me very interested 🤔
This shit look weak n corny
Looks boring as shit. Brie Larson looks disinterested. I had my doubts about this one and this trailer did absollutely nothing to change my opinion. Hard pass.
Thanos: *Shits pants*
Did she just punch a grandma?
When she punched the lady 
Great way to advertise film get person to punch old lady
Doesn't look very good. Not sure why they had to go with the shitty 2012 version of Carol Danvers as Captain Marvel instead of the classic Ms. Marvel. But as long as they don't make her a Dyke I'll consider it a win. Sick and tired of classic comic book super heroes being changed from White to some minority just to push the Hollywood diversity agenda. If you want to make minority super heroes then create new ones! Stop "appropriating" ours...
Ok so i looked at Grandma punch again frame by frame and Captain Marvel might also be telekinetic.
She is gonna hit thanos's ass
"Discover what makes her a hero" Then she punches the grandma's face in the next scene lmao.
Old Lady: You wouldn't hit an old lady now, would you?
1:31 yessss she punched a skrull 😁😁
Wow she just punched the old lady tho! I LOVE IT
I really wasn't going to watch this movie but i wanna know what happened to grandma. Is she ok?
Hoping that old lady was a Skrull...
The trailer was epic until she punched the old woman in the face.
Samuel L. Jackson sold me already
*Immediately followed by a shot of her punching a grandma*
People are acting as if we’re only going to get #1 trailer. Then you got the dumbasses who think she actually punched a old lady. Don’t you love when hatred is only guided by ignorance?
She punch that old lady wtf
01:30 ...when your grandma buys you a dc comic
Granny: Hey lady, why are you not sitting? Do you have a problem?
Anyone else see her punch the old lady or am I tripping?
1:31 punches old thot.
I expected something better than shit better venom ...
This I just see her punch an. Old Lady 👵 😂 😂 😂
You guys know that old lady was a skrull in disguise
Captain marvel : **hits an old lady**
What did the old lady do to you Captain?
Followed by your new superhero haymakering a smiling old lady on a subway with NO context (i.e. what Skrulls are), you are just making her look insane. I hope that was not the goal of this trailer.
I bet that old woman deserved to be punched
When grandma makes you the wrong cookies 1:30
old lady: guuurrrrl, it's me.
1:29 Punching an old lady so hard she explodes into flames
Why did you punch grandma in the FACE?
I want Shrek 5 not this bullshit
They should have totally made Nick Fury look like Jules from Pulp Fiction. When I think 90`s Sam Jackson, I picture Jules. They even put Jules` Bible quote on Nick Fury`d headstone in Winter Soldier
The alien was dressed up as the grandma
White people are so obsessed with this shit
1:30 punches old lady lmao.
1 like = 1 prayer for the old lady that got smacked
*punches grandma* 
So we ain’t gonna talk about how she just kicked an old ladies ass while it said Hero?
The 8.9k who dislikes are definitely DC  shitfanboys.
She does not fit the part..too white farm girl like...Need a stronger woman to play her!!
She PUNCHED a old lady! How does that not hype you up? MCU over DC all day.
So Mr . Jackson is doing a movie in his middle age being in old age.
I liked the trailer. Not completely sold on the voice Brie Larson is using for Captain Marvel though
did she just hit that jolly old lady in the face?
grandma is fingering herself again.
*immediately punches old lady*
This is gooood! That Grandma is a villain, obviously (or just a maybe lol). :D Now, I can't wait for the movie! <3 Also, I'm waiting for the Black Widow movie/trailer @marvel
Poor 👵 grandma(1like=1prayer for 👵👍)
Best part is Brie Larson punching an old lady!
Her knocking out the grandma, that is what I am looking forward to!
Wait hold on is that Ronan? 1:32
1:31 Old lady: hunny will you help me walk across the street?
50% comments: omg she punched and old lady 
Punching granny in the face huh?? SHAZAM's was better than this....
1:31 when grandma doesn't make cookies.
I hope she's not too overpowert so that she could kill thanos by one Punch.
Am I the only one who isn’t sold by her face like I don’t see the passion or is the savior of the avengers a cold face woman?
Captain Marvel out here whacking these poor grandmas. RIP.
Thank you Marvel for this distraction from the whole Henry Cavil not being superman and Ben Affleck not being Batman. Side note- That old lady was a skrull in disguise!
1:30 she killed the grandma 😂
I hope that old lady can take a hit. *No senior citizens were harmed in the making of this movie*
Damn granny caught that fade!
No. Hit on Asgard
Aaaaaaa shit thanos bouta get his mafuckin shit ROCKED
Well this is gonna be shit...
If you don’t know why the grandma lady got punched, you’re not a true Marvel fan.
Plot twist, the old lady was really an old lady, not a shape shifter lmao jk
cap. marvel is a man. not a weak woman.  what a bunch of bullshit
This is comment about that grandma .... like it ... couse that is what you do here ...
Kids.. don't punch grannies
Looks well shit
Hit like if your mind was fixed on the ooooooo ooooooo sound in the background
The old lady is a skrull. If you don't know what skrulls are, you aren't a true marvel fan
Respect the old lady
1:31 punch the lady out
So my son didn’t want to see Wonder Woman because Wonder Woman is a woman. I’m trying to show him that women can be just as powerful as men so when we play video games, i always choose a woman character to kick his ass with. He agreed to see Captain Marvel with me but i haven’t told him that Captain Marvel is a woman yet. I’m just gonna let him figure it out.
Ah shit.
Punching that Granny like a Hero 1:30
Also the grandma proves two things
Plot twist: Granny ain’t skull after all...
What it this bullshit
Old Lady: Hello darling, my name is Martha
fragmanına kurban olduğum 😍😍😍😍😍
a hero dont punch oldwoman broooo
Yall just ignoring the fact she punched someone's grandma at 1:32
People are really questioning the old lady getting punched in the face....really? Probably the same kinds of people who are "total nerds" cause they watch superhero movies -___-
Looks like shittt 💩💩💩💩💩 this is the first marvel movie I’m not hyped for.💩💩💩
1:30 when grandma keeps trying to make me eat and I already told her I wasn’t hungry
Go back to a time where Mace Windu had hair, punching the elderly was a-ok (wait what) and where 1:40 looks like a DC Batman movie scene......March 2019 The Movie
Well that looks shit
I just cracked a laugh when she punched the old lady LMAO
Jason Bourne, Douglas Quaid, Luc Deveraux, Andrew Scott, Mike Howell, Bob Reynolds ,Bucky Barnes, and the iron giant all say in unison: 
Relatable, everyone wants to punch some random granny
Did....did she just punch an old lady?!
superb waiting for so long marvel fan hit the like
I hope that grandma fights back in the movie
She just punch an old lady
hell yeah punch an old lady!!
Awaited to see the Punch to  Granny in big screen😂😂
Holy Shit!!! It's here guys, it's finally here!!!
Why she hit this old lady?:(
For every person who is going on about how she hits the old lady you have to understand the the old lady is most likely a skrull
Shitty costume and bad actress still
Why did she hurt a old lady ;-;
Captain marvel: “hold my beer”
Dayum she punched my auntie
Granny Skrull is gon lose some teeth
Maybe Old lady is Skrull ?
I think it looks good. Every time I doubt Marvel, they've rubbed my face in the dirt and kicked me with joy, so I'm optimistic. I don't care about the political bullshit one bit. Let the incels "protest" these movies. They don't matter a bit.
Şehitler ölmez vatan❤ 
I like where she punched that grandma in the face that was tight
Alright I’m down. Looks cool. Nice to see Coulson again. Lets hope that old lady was a Skrull.
If your movie has a blockbuster cameo and your main character punches a old lady then we will have a treat
Cough looks like shit cough cough she's gonna ruin avengers 4 cough
Wasn't really impressed with the Trailer (even though Grandma got knocked out!!)....But Hey, at least we still got..VENOM!
That’s thanos grandma. He angry that’s why he went on a rampage.
“A Hero” *punches old lady*
*imminently obliterates granny*
But whyyy would she punch a granny 😫
She hits that grandma harder than my dad
Huh, why is Captain Marvel trailer so cheap and boring I guess Samuel L Jackson is going to be holding this Marvel film together.
*punched grandma*
If she bashed up that poor old grandma, I would love to see she trying to bash up Stan Lee for his typical cameo appearance.
and then theres the madlads commenting about the grandma
1:31 when the train is full and the only seat available is taken up by this old lady's hand bags.
Who else freaked out when the old lady got punched?
When your grandma says Henry Cavill will not be next Superman.👊🏻
What if the whole movie is just about Captain Marvel beating the shit out of old ladies in the metro😂😂😝😝
Ohh shit younger Phil coulson
Skrull = Old lady?
Captain Marvel vs Old lady
*old lady entered the subway
Old lady is obviously a skrull
I feel like this was more showing what Phase 4 will introduce with the Skrulls, and likely the idea that they might take the form of the old heroes we love, or at least, that’s my overanalytical justification of why Brie Larson punches an old lady. It looks like it’ll be a mix of Man of Steel and Wonder Woman, in terms of story and quality, where the parts where she’s being human will leave something to be desired, but with some Samuel L. Jackson flair, it looks like it could still be pretty fun. Larson fits the image of Captain Marvel better than I was expecting, so I’m really excited to see her character more than anything else. Marvel’s casting is one of their best qualities, and this is no exception.
The reason why she punched the old lady is because the old lady is a skrull disguised as an old lady that's why for the people that didn't understand
Oooooooooo shit 😁😁😁😁😁
MAR VELL wouldve been a 100x better than Danvers. Movie looks pretty shitty to be honest unlike the latest Marvel movies
This shit gonna flop lowkey
Blockbuster!? Damn, this definitely is old.
The granny she punched was most likely a skrull.They're  shape shifters. 
That old lady is most definitely a Skrull, for those that were wondering why she punched that old woman. Lol.
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! How awesome does this look. By the way I think that old woman captian marvel punched was a skrull because they can form into different people. Also I'm glad nick fury is in this!!!
75% comments are about the old lady 
The 25k dislikes are all old ladies
that old lady. shapeshifting skrull
Thats my granny  ！！！！
Calling it now :D it will be shit :D do it,hate me for thinking that :D
I want to take this trailer seriously but every time she decks that old lady in the face I brake out laughing. I get that's its probably a disguise but still it's so surprising.
Also, LMAO. "What makes a HERo?" *smashes an old lady in the f***ing face*. So... abusing the elderly?
Anyone feel old from seeing that blockbuster ?
1:30 when ur grandma runs out of candy and gives u licorice😂😂😂
Bullshit. I am insane. I just scream after seeing this. I was out of control. No emotion. I can't believe. I don't know what is happening to me. I......😲😲😲😲😲😲😲🤣💦💦💦🤣💦💦😁😁😁😁😁😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘
Why would she slap a nice looking old lady?? XD
Is the old lady Stan Lee in disguise?!?!
I have to admit. I was very skeptical, but after this trailer, I'm friggin stoked. Brie Larson may pull this one off. Edit: and for those that say she needs to smile more. She smiled 3 times in this teaser, may be smiling under the mask flying thru space, and probably smiled after smacking the old lady. Besides, can you imagine her smiling thru all those serious scenes? It would suddenly be a DC movie.
They could’ve got a prettier white girl
Next scene: *hits an old woman
The old lady was a Skrull in disguise probably. Gotta get your skrulls right if you’re gonna have them in the film
IGN finally told me something good
Grandma doesn't feel very good.
When she punched that old lady. Daaaamn 🤣
@1:30 When your grandma asks if you’ve eaten yet for the 67th time in a day
*Grandma has left the group chat*
Thanos : Oh Shit! Wrong Universe.
That old woman was probably thanos' girlfriend or mom or something.
It looks like bad, but Captain marvel is a shitshow character in the comics so it represents her well i guess
Did she just punch that old lady in the face? Also, i thought captain marvel was a man
holy shit and she punch a grandma oh I going see it now
Just for this amazingness. When i get home I'm going to donkey punch my lady.
Captain Marvel is way to OP Look what she did to that Granny 😳
What did that old lady do to deserve what she got 🤣
1:30 when grandma comments on your weight.
God, I hope they leave that scene where Brie Larson punches the old lady in the face in the movie.
I will give it the benefit of the doubt atm but from their track record with female rolls in Hollywood movies, they will mary sue this character like THE FEMINIST AWAKENS. Till then i won't hold my breath.
Wtf grandma say or do to deserve that?!!!!!!!!
You guys are wondering, why captain marvel slaps the old lady?! It's bcoz, skrulls have the ability to change their resemblances to other forms. 
She was a Air Force pilot who was kidnapped by kree aliens in the late 80s or early 90s. The kree than experiment on her giving her superpowers and brain wash her Winter Soldier Style. For a few years she live and fight for them in space as one of their most powerful super solider. After the kree heard word that their enemies the Skrulls were about to invade Earth. They sent Carol on a mission to stop them. But during a big battle an explosion happen in space knocking Carol down to earth landing in a blockbusters. Explosion cause Carol amnesia. This makes her start to have memories of her old life on Earth. The space battle explosion and the crash was traced back to Carol by Shield with Nick Fury leading the investigation. Nick than brings her in (most liking after a car chase sence) at one of Shield earlier bunkers. He tells her she was a marine Soldier here before. (Not sure how. Maybe she match a missing person report). Carol also gets past memories of her life as a kree Soldier and is unsure who she really is. Meanwhile the kree Captain Mar'vel finds Carol and tried to convince her to come back. After that Coral teams up with shelid and the kree to fight the Skrulls.
Damn you know they old when you see that block buster. Lmaooo
Marvel stud10s... that’s it I’ve sold my soul to this franchise
When your grandma finds your stash and smokes it all. 1:30
Okay,​ Nick Fury's voice sounds like my dad's voice, old, intimidating, honest, serious, omg bruh and they both black, not to be racist.
When is Marvel going to release Captain Sandwhich? Never heard of it? Its an older tale. Its about a woman who stays home to make sandwhiches for her husband the construction worker, the real ultimate superhero story
I mean it’s hard to get on aboard  because of what writers are doing doing to her I actually like the actress in skull island but I just hope they do her right because this has been in the making for marvels second female super hero movie so they really have to hit this one out of the park
1:30 Poor Grandma didn't deserve that...
Still wonder why he slap that grandma ???
Captain Marvel's good deed for the day; when grandma keeps forgetting her dentures, you can just punch it into her face so hard that it gets lodged permanently in her skrull... i mean, skull.
This shit looks horrible
why she punch old lady like that? assume how will he punch thanos
Old lady: shazam it's you
When your grandma ask how much time
Shitposting is a universal language.  I know a Best Girl when I see one.
*Carol punches old lady*
Omg she punched that old lady😂
why did she have to punch an old lady it ruined the trailer for me
Why do i feel like that part with her hitting the old womans face is gonna stir up some drama and controversies. Gonna wait for all those articles tommorow about this
I still don’t know rat shit about her origins
Mum: Be nice to your grandma!
The old lady is a Skrull and so is the fake Fury.
Too many haters, was already sold on this movie and this trailer looks great.  Bree looks fantastic, or Clark Gregg is always a good thing
Rest In Spaghetti grandma
 900 million or   1 billion this movies box office Blockbuster  big hit movie

For those confused on why she punched an old lady
I think brie larson punching the grandma was the best part KKKKKKK
This is looking a lot like Green Lantern whether you like it or not. Except without all the shitty cgi and fart monster lol.
Hollywood Video, Lol. Shit takes me back, 💯
She just punched an old lady, who is most likely a skrull
When you're starving but your grandma doesn't give you food.
She just beat the shit out of that old lady LOOL
Im so excited! 😥👌🏼 rip old lady Skrull.
I know the hell she just slapped an old woman...Thanos beat her ass
Okay what I don't understand is Captain Marvel was supposed to be a Cree Soldier not human at all
"What makes her a hero?" Punching old ladies hard in the face obv
LOL WTF! what did that granny do ?
Capt Marvel: Where's the cupcakes granny?
I bet the grandma punch isn’t in the movie. And that’s all everyone going to be talking about after they see the movie.
In before it hits trending everywhere
1:30 me when i see old people
This generation sucks so bad that most Superhero movies take place in the 80's/90's. What a shitty decade!
Nothing like selling a marvel movie with punching an old lady in the face.
we supposed to see ultra super hero, but this is 80 year old women puncher.. MARVEL WHY? 1:31
Tony Stark (IronMen) : I stop one of my oldest friend from stealing my tech and try to kill me for it
Why u punch dat ol' ladee
Dunno what that old lady did but i trust cap with my life. Time go go out and clock old ladies across the face i guess.
Let's see how old he will get!
That old lady is a disguise. Like Maui - the shape shifter
She hooked that old lady without reason or context. like... she reached ALL THE WAY BACK. ahahaahaha. Can you imagine what its like for the people who dont know what a skrull is?
this movie is going to be a big hittt one of marvel best !!
31K grandmas disliked this video
1:29 took me a moment to realize the grandma was a skrull😂
It’s ok, it’s not grandma, it’s mother-in-law.
Wow!  Grandma got rocked! 😱 Got to see what was up with that!  Though the trailer did not look that exciting, I will give it a chance and go see it.
That old lady is definetly a skrull
Captain Marvel grandma invasion
Que epic climax in music while punching old lady.
I thought the comment section broke for a minute. Also why Cap. Marvel punched the "old lady" like that, lmao😂. They shouldve taken that part out of the trailer cus now certain people might start some controversy over it, ha
I cant believe she just punch that old lady.....
so the part where she hit the old lady at 1:31. is it gonna occur avengers 5 just like what starlord did?
Very dole and boring not really sold on her being Captain Marvel and this doesn't convince me.
Watching Carol punch an old lady made me woke
If she could punch an old lady, then Thanos really has no chance.
When grandma talking that smack
why did she slap the old lady
That trailer is shit ! Just like that protagonist Brie Larson!
 *flashes* *to* *grandma*
This trailer is shit.
Every like can stop granny abuse .
Stupid white girl overreacted to this trailer saying she looked like she could take on anyone at the scale of Galactus.
Grandma: Do u want a cookie? captain marvel: *punches in the face
Looks amazing and to the trolls who hit dislike move out of the basement of  your parents house 😜😜😜😜😜
R.I.P Old Woman...
After the Grandma she's going for Nick fury's eye
Wow this trailer looks pretty go.. *Captain Marvel punches old lady in the face*
Why do they make so shitty movies these days?
That sweet old lady didn't deserve that. She looked so nice happy to talk to you Carol. I mean it's not like she was a Skrull  or anything.
Best trailer theme ever. I mean damn does it sound epic. Just wish the scale of events shown could've been bigger. Hope they don't pull some Ant man and wasp bullshit and make the story small scale and stupid just because its an interquel/prequel or whatever.
I know that the grandma is a skrull that scene just kinda didn’t sit well with me
That was so savage when she hits that old lady
Did she just punch a old lady in the face?! lmao
Guys that old lady is obviously a Skrull calm ya self’s
Love it love it love it love it........... Ohhhhhhhhh maaaaaaaaaaan its freaking awesome.. Batshit awesome
Funniest part is when she punched an old lady right in the face
Why she smack that old lady
Holy shit balls
This must be old!
1:30 Yo wtf, she just punched an old woman??!
Hopefully they just put together a shitty trailer & the movie isn’t this soulless
captain marvel: punches her
classic capeshit trash
Maybe the old lady is a skrull
I honestly wasn't expecting her to punch that old lady...
I love how everyone is so quick to shit on this, yet nobody is actually bringing up any intelligent, legitimate reasons for why they dislike it.
Still not sold on Bree as Carol Danvers.
Thought she was boutta kill thanos but that grandma was good enough for me
*SPOILER* : The old lady was actually a Skrull......yes
She smacked the *INFINITY STONES* out of that grandma.
Did she just punch a grandma in the face??
Hit like if marvel > DC...
...Blockbuster? Wow, I feel old.
Upon her arrival, Captain Marvel’s expression shifts, and she punches Pepper in the Face, while Tony goes to help her up, Marvel stares down at Pepper ready to fight, while Nick looks at Marvel with intense eyes, before then the screen fades to black...
For those that think she hit an old lady, thats not an old lady lol
Hold on thanossss 🔥🔥🔥
Finally a real trailer. Not something crappy trailer with other Marvel movies obviously slap together passing as this trailer. And why the hell did she just punching old woman? Anybody else see that part?
1:31 did she just punched and old lady ?
Grandma: I stand by Judge Kavanaugh. 
This shit looks lame super skrulls better redeem this trailer
granny rights
Daemmm she thought grandma was Thanos 😀
new challenge incoming, called Smack a Granny 😂
Holy shit... I need to see this movie now!
she’s beauty, she’s grace, carol danvers can punch me in the face
The reason I am little disappointed with Captain Marvel is because she is getting introduced just to defeat Thanos. It's like create a great problem and present a dull convenient solution. The whole excitement is watered down. Atleast J K Rowling planted horcruxes and deathly hallows throughout the Harry Potter books making the finale to defeat Voldemort more credible.
And she just yeeted an old lady into the nth dimension
I watched this 5 times since yesterday and it finally hits me. This is a bad trailer.
Yeah! Show grandma who’s boss!
Ahahahaha so nobody’s gonna comment about an old lady gettin obliterated ?
That old lady at 1:31 is the real villain of the movie
Maybe the reason Nick Fury lost a eye was because Captain Marvel thought he was the old lady... Just an idea
That old lady that she socked was Thanos mother
Show some respect to old lady
At 1:30 I was sold to this movie
Poor Granny lmao
also rip grandma's face lmao
Grandma: "we're out of chocolate-chip cookies, dear."
When she slap the old woman i laughed so hard
*Is she granny from the mobile horror game granny movie comfirmed :P*
Finally a superhero to beat up old people. I wish it was Stan Lee instead of that old lady.
I see her punch the old lady on the bus and I think of Chris Tucker and Ice Cube in that scene in Friday and go "DAAAAAAAAAMN!!!" 🤣🤣🤣
Flashbacks and throwbacks of what said or mentioned by Samuel L. Jackson: alien invasion (Avengers 2012) and car chase (Captain America: Winter Soldier
This might sound like bad... but I'm okay with her hitting the old lady...I'm not okay with it being in the trailer because that WAS guaranteed to be the funniest scene in the movie. It'll probably be in the middle of a montage of her going around looking for Scrolls and now we're all expecting it. I bet they flip it and don't hit her at all and she's barely more than a glance/smile moment since "marvel humor" has extended to trolling us with the trailers
1:31 *When you find the lady that's been talking shit at Bingo*
I am really hyped to finally see why she hit the old woman.
Am I the only one who noticed that she hit a grandma
I'm sold :3
Who comes up with these stupid names? That old skinny fart?
no passion... no expressions... wooden...she looks so bored she could shit herself and not care... they had better explain that is the result of her fusion with jude law, otherwise this movie and the future of the MCU is truly screwed...
So we just gon ignore the fact that she just slapped the life out of that old lady.
The grandma she punched was probably and alien or some shit
" Shut your face grandma!!"
That old lady was really getting on my nerves
Captain Marvel: hold my beer
Why she punch that old lady?
She punched that grandma
She punched the old lady because it was a Kree indisguise
Why she pushing to old woman?
I'm sure Feminists will go crazy about that but we can all agree granny is the more important topic
She hit the Freak out of the old lady
1:31 when your grandma says she's writing you out of her will.
She is a horrible actress. She has that Ryan Reynolds thing going on where she always looks bored and delivers every line with a monotone voice.
Captain marvel: no i want a sucker punch soda please PUNCH!
This looks shitter than green lantern but I am still watching it for Phil Coulson
1:30 when your granny ask you to repeat what you said because of her bad hearing.
RIP the old lady :(
1:30 When I can't eat anymore Grandma
Did she just slap an old lady!!!
tired of hearing yall shit on brie’s acting and facial expressions. she has a whole oscar. how many yall got ?
when your grandma doesnt get you vbucks
Better than 2.0 shit teaser.Actually it is not 2.0 teaser is far better than this.I would like to know the budget of this film?
will still watch, cuz she punch an old lady
either she is not used to earth customs so she was offended by the old lady or GRANNY WAS A SKRULL
Incoming Grandma Meme's 2019
Looks like shit mostly
In avengers 4, I swear if she beats the shit out of Thanos and overpowers everyone...I will revolt.
Best scene ever...Grandma...haha
Poor grandma, that was racist when she hit the grandma
this comment section is so 🤦🤦🤦 obviously it won't be as good of a trailer as IW had,, why would you even hold it to that expectation when IW had a 10 year build up. If you don't like it, okay, whatever but I mean this is the very first Captain Marvel movie, with nothing to base it off (I'm talking strictly mcu, not comics, bc lbr don't everyone reads the comics). Give it a chance damn.
Awful. I hate Carol in the comics, I would never pay to see this shit! The only Captain Marvels that I will ever support are Marr-Vell, Monica Rambeau, Rick Jones, Genis-Vell, or Teddy Altman.
No.1 trending...shitden :))
She punch a grandma lmao
Oh shit Flash f***** the timeline again
Also maybe that old lady was mean guys xD
Why is she punch that poor grandma?
The reason they put the scene where she punch a grandma is so that we fellow watchers can talk about it in the comment section below 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The old lady is a Skrull, cmon it's pretty obvious due to the fact that they weren't show on the trailer, and if case you don't know what they can do, they can shape their form and look like anyone
She just punched an old lady!!!  Ahhaha
Grandma probably had it coming.
Sounds like a  feminism shit to me
Poor old lady 😅
Better you watch whole movie,  not just in trailer,  maybe the old lady is a monster or something bad happen
So great to see Coulson in a MCU film again. Nick Fury's de-aging process looks great. @0:39 you see Fury holding an ice bag to his eye. People are so desperate for another MCU film this one is going to get a lot of attention. Old lady has to be a Skrull. Do you think the last Blockbuster in Bend, Oregon paid for product placement?
*1:30** Grandma Got Smaked For What Again*
Marvel has finally hit rock bottom.
Punching a grandma in the face apparently
"then punches the old lady'
She beat an old lady😂😂😂wtf...an why they couldn't choose a better looking white woman or ambiguous black octaroon?
Bullshit Bullshit Bullshit Bullshit
She punched the old lady😂 I get that it was a scroll or whatever but that was kinda funny

Damn she punched that old lady?
I was gonna pass n just wait for the final gaunlet war to come out until she sucker punch the shit out of the old lady....I'm sold!!! 😑
Why'd she hit a old lady tho?
One punch man on old lady
Oh shit blockbuster!
Who knows about the movie, Brie (Isn't that a  moldy crusty on the outside gooey on the inside cheese that isn't good for anything but spreading on crackers)seems in command of the "dower" and boring nature and complimented by a terribly annoying nasal voice which would probably work for the current comic book character. From the trailer it doesn't look like a must see but maybe 99 cent RedBox, which says more about how bad the trailer is as well as how disinclined I am to use RedBox. It/she still looks better than the latest iteration of the comic character to its credit. All the comic book character needs is blue hair, a lip ring, and nose stud. The most dower of all current Marvel comic book characters which has been a relaunch after relaunch failure after failure regarding actual sales of comic books. And the people at Marvel basically say, "we have Disney money now, eat the product and shut the f up." Horrible sales for the current "flag ship character." Captain (current comic iteration) Marvelesbian had nothing to do with comic canon Infinity War which is probably why it was a success, and Carol Danvers is a poor choice substitute for Adam Warlock in the canon story. Hell this review has more views than Cpt Marvel has sold comic books since Carol Danvers took on the Marvel mantle in 1968. I am afraid we are about to see Disney utterly ruin another franchise (Avengers). But the good news is they will release a new trans  Disney princess movie where the She/he is knocked up by a non binary gender fluid beta donor and they harvest the aborted stem cells like pixie dust for the Stan Lee rejuvenation project. As for Ms Larson contempt for any part of her audience especially the demographic that has created the comic book industry ( another savvy business wahmen) she is probably not going to lose any viewers, in fact they should have had her go for the full lesbot persona, except let's face it she looks like a doughy pudge not the lean mean lesbian machine of current iteration or the fully developed bombshell image of the 60s and 70s. At any rate so far no amount of marketing or force feeding has created an audience that has made this character recognizable to anyone outside the primary demographic that follows the genre, which is white males, dumbshit.
that old was a skrull lmao
Punches old lady😂
We have a new Meme Captain Marvel punches old ladies! Call Ya Boy Zach!
1:30 ..when grandma is being racist again.
Fellow Marvel fans: Some of the better trailers I've seen were from trash movies and vice versa so dont judge this movie too quick! Also, was that granny a skrull?
1:30 LOL i think see gonaa help the old women😂😂😂
Did anyone else laugh when she punched that old lady?
1:31 old woman? Why? What did she do to you? =)
i think the old lady wouldn't be a skrull because if the old lady is a skrull then you're wasting some comedy gold
It's gonna be funny seeing her power up for the movies compared to her comic character. In the comics she has laid into hulk with several punches, he just stood there and smiled at her, while she backed up with a look of fear. He then punched her from ground level, through a helicarrier, and into space within seconds. She's a bit below Iran man in power, and iron man would get crushed by hulk or thor.
Umm m I Only one who's sorry for that Old Lady. .Even tho I know she's obviously someone Bad in Disguise!?
Oh no my grandma... :'((
1:30 grandma got smacked for what again💀
Eh 😴 I am not too impressed. Maybe if they casted somebody else and older. 
she punched dat old lady lol
@1:31 She punched Gam-gam
*hold her by the hair*
This is kickass and all, but I can't help but wonder what the context was behind Captain Marvel getting into a fistfight with an old lady. Seriously, that woman got sucker punched so hard she flew right into the next Avengers movie. If she takes any more hits she'll be so far in the future that DC might have a good movie out by the next time we see her.
Captain Marvel punching an old woman? Wow
She punched the hell out of that old lady.
A True Hero Would Kick The Old Lady, Not Punch...
She punches an old lady because she is/may be a skrull a shape shifting alien
Honestly. As long as she doesn't KILL Thanos in the end (that spot is for the Avengers, she should carry the next generation, not end the old one) I feel good about this.
Someone please make the scene where she hits the old lady a meme!!!
SKRULLS (that old lady was definitely a skrull or things are definitely gonna be awkward) 
So are we gonna ignore the fact she punched an old lady in the face?
she just punched a old lady........
My Mama said its bad to hit old lady
the grandma was probably a skrull
Trailer so good makes you want to slap your grandma
I'm just surprised the old lady scene didn't get more backdraft.
wait marvel lets ladies getting punched?
I'm gonna watch it just to see an old woman getting thumped in the jaw
lol. This looks like the most average shit ever
Hit a Like if you are hyped for Marvel Studios newest Creation - CAPTAIN MARVEL
10/10 will go kick old ladies after this
Same shit different day
Captain Marvel is proving very stale and boring in the comic universe right now, not to mention politically charge. I don’t think Marvel did good chosing this actress who is stale, boring and yes, pilitically charged. I used to like CM, in the good old days and when a CM movie was announced a while back I was actually hopeful Marvel studios would fix this character to her glory days. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like this will be the case. In fact this looks like it will mark the beginning of the end of the MCU that we grew up with and came to love.
this bullshits supposed to be stronger than thor?
4. Old woman probably rooted for Wonder Woman. She got what she deserved.
She gonna beat the shit outta thanos
Everyone talking about that Grandma not knowing it's a skrull...
Damn it! Delete this shit! Let killshot stay at the top of trending!!!!
The shot with the lights turning with the beat got me good. It's vague, which is good, and it's well put! The punch to the old ladies face though haha
I get it......this is actually the placeholder, not the movie. The studio just takes this placeholder and puts an actor from any demographic, superhero or vigilante, amnesiac secret agents or assassins, alien or domestic, a particular time in history, a place in the universe etc it does not matter (only Sam Jackson is a constant) and you have a blockbuster (not like the one here) movie. This time they decided that the fans (sheep) cannot tell the difference anyway so why not just take the placeholder and put an Oscar winning actor, some bullshit story and call it a movie. It will save both time and money and make maximum profit.
1:31 **Smacks Grandma in the face**
Man, would sure be cool to see enlisted. Officers are shitty enough as is.
So this is green lantern? Dang Ryan Reynolds shoulda did this
Opening shot of the Blockbuster Video store already sold me on the movie
Guess what movie I’m not gonna watch. Not that I think it’ll be a bad movie. It’s just that I don’t give a shit enough.
Did she just hit an old lady, Was she a Skrull?
another white women super hero killing a bunch of men smh😏 damn how many movies they gon make. don't nobody wanna see this shit😂
Holy shit this looks awesome!!
she just punches an old lady lmfao
Will everyone who's so hurt that SHAZAM has a movie even tho originally it was settled that Captian Marvel is now Marvels Heroine and Shazam is awesome no matter the name...can we just appreciate that comic movies are getting better despite anything...yea DC drops the ball alot but there trying and Marvel has hits an Misses...I wasnt a fan of Age Of Ultron or Black Panther YEAH I WASNT!!! Just like Suicide Squad and Wonder Women wasnt so hot on me either. Were in a new movie watching era where we can sit back pop are 3D glasses on buy over expensive snacks...*I dont* and just enjoy that we have the most epic cross over since Daffy Duck met Bugs Bunny...*YEAH THAT WAS A THING* so stop with the hate on both ends and let us rejoice that comic book movie trailers and the movie itself is at an all time high!!! Only thing I'll criticize this movie for is if Stan Lee isnt gonna Cameo it as he rightfully deserves even if he didnt make the heroes Marvel wouldn't exist if not for his part....and I finally find out how Nick lost his eye....youtube nation SHUT YP AND TAKE MY $13.00 Or $5 on Tuesday...I'm an AMC Srubs member after all...
when the batidick is more popular than your shitie trailer
she slapped the wrinkles out of that granny
Granny: Kamehamehaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I came for the granny punch
Marvel is definatley gunning for films to take $$$ from 10 yr olds ... Kaching !
This was a turrible teaser trailer. Tells us nothing about the character, very little about the story, normies will think the new Marvel Superhero just clocked a grandma and Brie has perpetually one face: bored.
Nothing at all against good female leads, I'm looking forward to it. Just please, don't inject any identity politics bullshit into it.
1:30 when some old lady ask ur peanut butter
1:30 When grandma escapes the retirement home and you gotta bring her back

Thumbs up if you're so old you rented videos as a kid .. :)

A reason to beat up grandma
I think that grandma is a skrull
1:31 Stop old lady abuse today
Plot twist: the grandma was thanos
damn she punched the shit out of that old lady
This trailer looks great, I'm really excited. I'll be honest, I was a little concerned given the current climate in the entertainment industry: push female and non white characters in promotions so when the movie gets criticized you can pull some cheap shots and label all fans as bigots. The comic books don't have much good source material for this character, but given the past ten years of interesting varied characters crafted and presented by the MCU I do trust the creative leads on this one
Tired of this shit.
The old lady was a Nazi, there I just fixed the trailer.
1:30 when you recognize the old Angel demon lady who crawled on the wall in the movie Legion.
Her smacking the grandma was best lol
I’m the type of n**** that will punch your grandma
 *Punches an old lady. 
My granma gone viral after that old lady got punch in a face. Lmfao! 😂
Imagine this shit but with Charlize Theron , it would've been great
The old lady on the bus was a pro-life Trump voter, so...

Captain Marvel: punching a grandma that I don't even know.
1:31 when your grandma has makeup supplies in a cookie box
When she punch that old white lady. I know shes  a hero
I think that old lady is scrul 🙌
Hitler was right
Like uh, this is bullshit, they totally should've made captain marvel a black single mom. Marvel needs to check it's privilege.
1:32 she just slapped somebodys grandma bro. Wtf.
she punched a grandma
So we're all just going to ignore the fact that she just molly-whopped an old lady, skroll or not she did not hesitate
OOOOOOO THIS LOOKS MINT!! Also the part where she punches the old lady has just become a meme😂.
Just came for the memes about granny being slapped
(Captain Marvel punches old lady)
Plays clip of punching an old women.
**smacks old lady**
what a hero that HAHAHAHAHAH, smacks a old lady I'M STRESSED HAHAHAHAHAH
I wish more action scenes against some of Captain Marvel's fans were added in the trailer. Slugging an old lady? What the? lol. 😂
1:31 damn she punched an old lady?
Wanna be a hero?? Punch a old lady in the face.
I guess grandma was representing the evil forces and deserved this punch, otherwise a punch would also get a girls superhero reputation.
This trailer is for only 9 year old
We just going to ignore that fact that she just knocked the shit out of an old lady? xD
Miss me with that wrong casting bullshit and show some respect for Oscar winning actress Brie Larson.
I watched this trailer on 1080p and still it a shit.
Man, how i wish she mistakenly hit that poor old woman and got arrested. that would be an awesome marvel joke better than deadpool's.
Brie Larson punching that old lady is gonna be the meme of the year just wait
*1:30* Maybe that Old Lady is a Skrull!?!
1:31 when  grandma gave you a Birthday card with no money
That will be shit
marvel fans hit like
I'm punching the next old person I see too
1:30 that was the funniest shit. 
Did she just punched an old lady for taking her seat??? 😮
Did she just sock an old lady? Lmao
Thanos gonna piss his shit now
64k grandmas didnt like this trailer
To all the people who are feeling underwhelmed by this trailer, Captain Marvel will be released in March 2019 and this is just the teaser of what is about to come. MCU isn’t stupid enough to pack all the good stuff in a single trailer. They are building hype and y’all will get to see all the great stuff in the upcoming trailers. So hold on to your wigs till then!
Punching old ladies and the Binary form. Yeah, you've got me.
everyone out there thinks and say awesome that Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and Hawkeye will be in avengers infinity war part 2 April or May 2019 and everyone else out there think and say  awesome that let Robert Downey Jr aka iron man, Chris Evans aka Captain America and all the old actors aka all the marvel universe cinema characters stay and play there Marvel Universe Cinema characters for Avengers Infinity War part 2 you all decide of this.?
She really just punch poor Dc in the Face
Wait what ? did I really just see she punched that grandma?
Let’s see how old he can get!
Guys relax the old lady is a skrill, but it'd be funny as hell if she wasn't. And it turns out shes just sn old lady lmao
1:30 How to forget when Captain Marvel hit Aunt May.
Did anyone else feel old seeing that “Blockbuster Video” in the beginning?
is that you grandma?
Finally a wonder woman unafraid to punch an old lady
Man she molly-whopped Grandma-ma...😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Terrible actress and an even worse costume Holy shit 😭
*captain marvel hits grandma* 
Captain Marvel: *punches glasses off of her goddam face*
Next old lady to smile at me in gonna captain marvel her ass 👊😂😂😂😂
1:30 grandma grandma yes captain marvel did you eat my churro no captain marvel telling lies no captain marvel open your mouth hahaha slam!!!!
1:30 why the old lady :(  XD LOL
Did anyone else pause and rewind when Captain Marvel punched the smiling old lady on the bus?
Bruh, is this coming out on the WB channel along side Green Arrow? Cuz that chick looks like a tv actor. This cant be a movie coming out at the theater. It looks low budget AF. I would not even pay the early bird showing price at a theater to see this trash. Let me help you guys out at Marvel Studios. Fire that chick and hire a real movie quality actress. Hire Saoirse Ronan, and you will have a blockbuster hit, a movie classic that they will be watching till the end of time. Thank you 🙏✌️
cuts to captain marvel punching an old lady.
"Captain Marvel Punches Old Lady"
Im waiting for Rogue to kill off Brie Larson...i mean "Captain" Marvel. And before anyone starts with the "sexist" shit I'm a girl who reads comics. They picked the whitest most valley girl indie actress in history to play an iconic character.  At least DC tried with Gal Gadot!
Marvel has gone down hill  this will be their first non hit  financially, if this is a trailer  eeech !
She said this wasnt made for white dudes, so ill be glad to premiere this in my living room opening night 👍
I'm sold
Trailer: "a hero"....two seconds later she punches an old lady😂
Trailer is shit tbh
This Is Gonna Be Super Hit Movie Of 2019 Let's See Who Is Agree With Me?😍
Holy shit, blockbuster, I know what that is!
Nostalgia hitting me hard with that Blockbuster logo 😋
Trailer is not that great  hit like if u r agree
I don t give a shit about captain marvel. I just wanna know why nick fury called her before SPOILER. All i care about are the guardians of the galaxy and the avengers
Cant wait! Looks bloody fantastic! Marvel just shits all over DC at the moment!
**Punches the shit outta grandma**
Although I'm rooting for her to be a racist old lady who gets what she deserves
looks wack as shit
why tf she be punching that old lady for
He killed a old grandma
FINALY MY PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED!!! But punching an old lady to savage😂 and skrulls not what I imagined
Looks ok, to bad the actress shit all over fans. Get woke, go broke.
Captain Marvel savin the world from Evil one old lady at a time...>_>
1:30 that old lady is super skrull
Thanos:shit😅!!
i like the movie but i’m just hoping they make Carol funny because the females in Marvel can’t really compare to the males when it comes to humor which is sad, and the outfit wasn’t my favorite because it’s a little tacky. i know it’s the iconic red and blue and gold but i think it would have been cuter with a red, gold, and off-white color. but i guess it’s supposed to look cool not cute lmao
Prob it will be shit or not that good, but reviews will give it 10/10 because they're afraid that they'll get backlash if they give it a bad rating, because if they'll do they'll be called sexist.
The grandma is a kree
Who's here befor it hits a million views?
I don’t watch capeshit
Did she punch a old lady
When your grandma be a skrull
That blue and gold marvel logo be looking real awesome
I feel sorry for that old lady.
Avengers post credit, Nick : "Motherf---------," , The complete sentence wold have been: "Motherfuc*er  Thanos! She is coming for ya!!!!!  My babe is coming for ya!!   Woohoo!!".
1:31 why did you hit grandma in the face?
*_1:31_**_ she slapped an old woman!!!😓_*
Did she just punch an old woman in the face? Sold!
This looks sicc. And anyone who will punch an old lady like that has got my attention.
Oh shit...... I am done with Mcu....... Last hope is for shazam iron man and spider man
Captain Marvel: Grandma Puncher
This made me forgot Superman Henry quiting bullshit in DC completely!!! MCU is light years away now!
She just WorldStar'd an old lady on a Subway. Bruuhhh...
I'm a little bit dissapointed on the way that she punched the old woman because you can clearly see that they didn't even try to make an effort to make the punch closer to the old woman you can see that her hand is far away from her face
Carl Manvers looking shitty as expected... It was good while it lasted, MCU...
In the earlier days, when only few Marvel films were out, I saw a long list of upcoming Marvel movies and Captain Marvel was one of them. I thought "Planning all these shit already? They are too far ahead of themselves. Who the f*** are Thanos and Captain Marvel anyway?". For the next ten years I've witnessed all those plans come to life and MCU becoming the most influencing movie franchise in the world. it really is a dream come true. God bless Marvel. God bless Kevin Feige.
This looks pretty shit. Brie Larson has done a small amount of great films, but other than that she's a pretty shit actress. Just give us an Avengers Infinity War Part 2, instead of this crap
She punched an old lady!  Im sold!
this is good enough for 1st trailer. but feel like it’s more a teaser for me. for people who doesn’t know captain marvel and then watched her punch an old lady can be  quite confusing. 😂😂😂
I'm waiting for the porn parody for this one! Will it also have a granny to "smack"?
Is that captain marvel >:( remember old lady sir
Looks like shit
Şehitler ö❤ 
So excited for this. Also yay for punching old ladies. Skrulls can come in any form! :)
From now on we need to punch old ladies to make sure they are not aliens. 👌👏😘
Part of the reason the MCU works is it's Earth-199999.  Respect for the source material with fresh approaches for the stories so new fans can find out the reasons why these characters are so loved and old fans (like me) have a reason to go see a movie.
Old Woman With a Skrull 😈🕑
Damn, what did that old lady say to trigger her like that?
ummm did she just punch an old lady!?!?!
carol just punching that old lady lol XD
It is.. okay i guess? She punches a grandma. I don't think even Thanos would go that far...
Omg!! I cant hold on😦😦
*Hit like if you think it will break the internet ❤️❤️*
When I saw her punch the old lady I was like "WHAT?!! WHY DID SHE DO THAT?!!!?!!" But then I remembered the skrulls are in this one and then it made sense.
They finally did it, they made a sequel to Green lantern, where is Ryan Renolds?
that's badass punching old woman
*Would have thought that thanos is disguised like grandma's body*
OMG Did she hit a granny?!!!! WTF
She had a life hire! She punched  old womens or  skrulls?
Holy shit, l almost peed in my pants when l saw this...marvel rules!!!!!😂😂😂😁😁😁
Please tell me that old lady she socked was a skrull
1:30 When Granny keep asking you when you getting married
Holly shit !!!! she is soooo cool 😎
Looks like Shitty and cheap wonder woman 🤣🤣.
Old lady is main villan
Me: *punches an old lady in the face*
This is white supremacy
Holy shit she had the comic book helmet
The old lady ain’t an old lady she’s a Skrull lol
Holy shit, even Batman is in this!
WE WANT THE CAPTAIN MARVEL TO BE ASIAN... and mulan becoming white
“A hero” * punches smiling old woman in the face*
When grandma doesn't drink her grape juice 1:31
When Grandma don't give you cookies 1:30
I really hope that old woman wasn’t a skrull
For the people that tell her she needs to smile more I think it's bullshit because she's not gonna smile throughout the entire movie even when she's facing the big bad at the end of the movie it's gonna look stupid. What do u want? To have her smile while getting her ass kicked by skrulls? Her saying "Yeah I'm getting my ass kicked but still smiling :)". Doesn't make sense so just enough with the bullshit with her not smiling.
My favourite part was when she punched an old lady.
*Punches old lady*  Me: Shut up and take my money!
LMAO this is going to be shit
that grandma is the Skrull
I'm thinking that the old lady has to be a Skrull.
*rip* *old* *lady*
Remember when trailers told the entire story? Glad they stopped doing that.
Damn how you gon do grandma like dat
Your grandmas are no longer safe...
Did captain marvel just punch a old lady
People are shitting on her and this is just a TEASER. The salt is real with these cucks holy shit
Just the same old smoke and flashbags. Nothing new to see here.
Grandma is a DC fan.
12K people got punched with the reality stone
Holy shit Coulson with a full head of hair.
That granny is Captain Marvel's old age version.. Look closely.. So that's an alien for sure disguised as Marvel's old age version.
All I seen was her punching out aunt may
An anonymous YouTuber liked your submission so much that they gilded it, giving you YouTube gold.
Grandma got punched because she is probably a Skrull!!!
1:30 when my granny asks about my academic status
When she hits the granny tho' 😂😂😂
Anyone else see her knock that granny out
How is punching a grandma hype, I love marvel but this trailer was just wtf
Did the Grandma say my dear where is your butt?  and why the long face! you will never get a Man to ask for your number! you would think that would have put a smile on her face lol. Her tweets and this bland trailer PASS.
WTF Captain Marvel is bullying an old lady!!!!!!
don’t get me wrong, this looks really good... but honestly i dont give a shit, all i want is for avengers 4 to come out...
Grandma is a Skrull in disguise
Pretty sure the granny that Carol punched was Talos.
Hit Like if you are able to find out Cap😎..
Guess you can say Captain Marvel hit the blockbuster.
damn The way she slapped that old women lmao
This trailer is Bullshit.
I’m amazed that all of you can watch under 2 minutes of a trailer and automatically call the movie shit.
1:31 when your grandma says she can’t give you any money
1:31 when your grandma doesn’t buy you cookies
Is it sad that i laughed when i seen that old lady get punched in the face.
1:30 is when granny didn't ask you if you ate or not
She's fighting the skrulls in the movie who are shapeshifters that's why she punched the grandma bcuz it was a skrull
... not that good of a trailer. All I got from this is that captain marvel hits old ladies
Omg so cool I can’t wait 😊!!!!!!!! “We have no idea what threat are out there” and she punched an old lady 👵🏻 lol 😂
it doesnt look like shit
Damn who would've thought that being a hero was that simple. I guess I better go punch some old ladies in the face
I died when she beat up the old lady. XD
she just punch old woman , she dont deserve to be captain marvel ,  but savage marvel 😂
Old lady: oh hello there dear would like a cookie
That poor old lady XD
(Yes, I know the old lady is a Skrull)
I'm not really sold to be honest. :|
Did they just combine Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel into this bastardization of a superhero? If so this is shit and WTF Marvel!!?
wait a minute,what what she punched an old lady
10/10 would punch granny again
Am sold just from that blockbuster cameo!! I mean, come on, that was gold!!!!!
Rip to that old lady
Punches old lady damn
Okay who else literally lol'd when she punched the old lady?
cool trailer hit like if you agree
I really hope that old lady turns out to be evil...
She straight up punched an old lady lmao
Looks shit - like if you agree 👍🏻
did she just punch an old lady
Not completely sold yet. I want carol to be strong take no prisoners and I don’t hear that in her voice or her acting. However I like the it more on second watch
(A Hero)  Immediately punches a old lady
Does this also mean I can go around Punching old Ladies, just in case they're Skrulls???
I really liked the part when she hits that old lady. 
Old Lady Lives matter!!!
I think that anyone who really don't know why captain marvel punch an old lady is because they not an actual mcu fans
She is mōre or lêss like the female version of Thor......& secondly the music reminds me of some old vìdeo gãme music
Trailer released an hour ago and "Carol punching old lady" is already a meme.
Holy shit, this trailer was bad
I'll give this movie its day in court. But man did she look bored as shit.
90% of comments are about grandma
Comment readers please hit the like button😀😀
*I'm almost sure.....Marvel punched Rosa Parks on that bus*
1:44 the shitty one liner to end all others
if this movie will hits in theaters black widow film is a go signal
You guys are all wrong, Skrull is disguised as Captain Marvel and we gonna hate fxxking bad Skrull who hit a nice granma.
*_Why dids she punched a grandma why WHY WHY_*
Everyone Wondering that at 1:31 miss marvel punched an old lady ... probably it's  a skrull ( they can shapeshift )
soooo is that old lady a skrull? or what
You punch 👊 an old lady ! Still I want to WATCH your movie Captain Marvel !
If she can beat up that Grandma she can beat up Thanos with one punch
Grandma: Do you want some cookies?
I can't wait for the "IF YOU DON'T WATCH THIS YOU'RE SEXIST" clickbait articles that come out when this movie hits.
Marvel gonna take a major financial loss on this bullshit
Eh, tbh looks kinda lame, but it's going to get a shit ton of money just because the fans want are obviously going to watch this movie to learn her origin and how she's going to tie into the infinity war story thing.
Punching Grandma YES 👍
Grandma is Donald Trumps mom
1:31 When your grandma don’t buy you v-bucks to buy the battle pass!
Grandma- "Whaaa...."
Did anyone get shocked when she just punched the old lady? I did. This movie (imo) does not look that hype.
Why is there no comments about Captain Marvel punching grandma? (I know it's a skrull but still...)
I'm not sold on the trailer but it could be good. Not much of a tease of her power. If she's going to be the strongest in the MCU then I was hoping we would get a solid tease of her power in the trailer. Her lighting up with energy is ok but many characters can do that. 
preview😂......cause now I’m just sorry for grandma 😔💕❤️
Heroes punch old ladies.
Captain Marvel is one of the more heavier hitter, isn't she? How strong is she? I know somewhere here is comicbook pro who can answer me that.
1:30 was the grandma bad or something lmfao rip
Young nick fury had me sold
Hold up why is it set in the 90's when infinity war was already set after 2020?
All those 20,000 dislikes are because she punched that old grandma calling it
Who wants to bet that the old lady is a skrull?
Bumper , mega , super hit 
1:30 holy shit that surprised me poor granny
Oh she punching punching old ladies
Did she punch that old lady at 1:31
*Punches old lady in the face* 😂
Did she just punch the spit out of an old lady?!
Damn she smacked grandma like that 😂😂
I just shit myself.
She just clapped that old woman round the face 😂
Super power = Granny Bashing
I'm just gonna go ahead of myself and assume that Grandma is a Skrull.
She punched a old lady
My birthday is in March. Maybe my grandma can bring me to see this.............
1:30 WOAH ok! Marvel's punched too many people for one day! Wrap it up!  
~The old lady is a skrull (the bad guys)
What you actually want to do when you give an old lady your seat 1:30
Omg😱😱😱😱😱😱 Grandma
Grandma: Nani?
Oh shit..... THANOOOSSS COME HERE FOR A MINUTE
Is her punching an old lady a reference from the comics?
Wtf did she just punch the shit out of an old lady jesus christ I was not expecting that
SHAZAM trailer (OG Captain Marvel) is way better than this boring white bread toast cm.
Hit Like For Captain Marvel 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
that grandma is transformed skrull
Will they make her look old in Avengers 4?
Yup, I'm sold. Anyone complaining about this trailer is just being a hipster contrarian. This sh*t looks like it's gonna be amazing!
i lost it when she punched the old lady skrull
To everyone say her character is brainwashed... She is not. Stop making up shit. I swear it almost like you people don't attempt to read the comics this boring movie is based off. Oh wait. Y'all don't. 
she hit an elDerLy
1:31 When an old lady tells you that captain america is not strong enough to fight thanos.
I’m curious, but boy does Brie Larson seem to be acting kinda wooden, I’m not entirely sold on whether she was a good choice for the role.
Punching old ladies apparently
same shit as always...
Why in the hell did she just punch an old lady?!
No old people were harmed. 1:30  Lmao
punch to old lady was amazing😂😂😂
Batman would beat the shit out of her... 
Not so marvellous at all, heroes don't go around punching old ladies in the face =P
Holy shit that's embarrassing. Girl has 0% ass and 0% ability to smile.
holy shit. i stan.
There's a skrull copying her.. That's why the skrulls memory is all foggy, because it was implanted memories, and that granny is sure as hell a skrull in disguised.... The hype is real boys
Who else laughed when she punched the innocent looking grandma lol
Punching an old woman in her first trailer? ... crazy feminist alright haha...
Idk about how movie is gonna be but i must say the score is sick as f it goosebumped the shit outta me. Well about the movie we could wait for trailer 2 to get better perspective don't wanna judge so soon
Captain Marvel:*punches old lady*
Old lady suspect! Reminds me of Men in Black.
1:31 That Punch Is SO FAKE!
Shit if she got binary already thanos aint stand a chance if his gauntlet ruined
boomers are the ultimate evil, punch any and all boomers you see
She could beat the shit out of thanos with the avengers
1:31 when grandma mistakes your skittles for her medication
Weird decision for Marvel to include a scene were Captain Marvel punches an old lady. Its just wtf.
Everyone's talking about an old lady getting punched in the face while barely anyone's noticed Ronan from GotG 1:32
You still don't have me sold on your choice for who you casted as Captian Marvel
Why she punch nanny
I think Thanos won't know what hit him

Looks pretty shit to me
Isn't that the old Blockbuster?
My grandma: We ran out of churros
*Punches a grandma*
lmfao  the thing i'm most interested in right now is why did she punch granny?
Looks shit.I don't think she will be able to take place of Thor and hulk
that poor old lady tho
1:31 Take that random old lady!!!
Bruh when she hit that lady i burst out laughing my bad
I’m only 9 years old I would like if anybody 
What if in The Avengers 4 she is brainwashed like Winter Soldier by another big villain and she attacks The Avengers when they enter the Quantum Realm and they need to face her. She is about to kill them and then she sees Nick's message and starts to remember. Then she helps everyone and they tell her about Thanos and she tells them that there is even bigger villain and they lose their mind like I did when I heard about it.
People think this piece of shit can beat me? Haha! Pathetic.
Marvel is going to bang out another MCU hit with this one!
poor old lady 
That old woman gave her a flashback that she *really* didn't like.
Did Captain Marvel just deck a granny? Lol. This is going to be amazing!
The old lady gonna be trending soon...
Finally its here!!!!! AntiThanos hit like!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:31 what I did to my grandma after I saw The Visit
I don't care if she's a grandma. If she stares at me longer than 3 seconds, I'm gonna punch her face.
She hit that nani at the end
Old ladies are the worst for spreading fake joy and happiness.
Old Lady " DC's bett..." 
Ok so blockbuster throwback, she punch a granny? And damn she finneeeeeeee

Wow she punched an old woman, SO EPIC!
Damn why she punch Betty White like that ? 1:30
Why couldn't she have been Chinese, black, Indian, Russian, or anything but a white blonde??
Unfortunately the next trailer is going to reveal too much because ppl keep poking fun at the grandma.
Did she really just deck an old lady in the face? Haha
Was pretty cool till she punched an old lady for no reason. Coulda left that out of trailer if they not gonna xplain it. Lol tho.
Hard to explain with an American accent.. another white alien.. I thought illegal aliens were brown..
My dislike just because they cast Brie Larson as Miss Marvel their are numerous female actresses who can make that character their own like how RDJ didn't just acted as Tony Stark but became one similarly Hugh Jackman for Wolverine and Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Chris Evans as Captain America.
Heavy hitter comin though!
Dislike that Shit
1:31 Did you see the punch WTF... 🤣🤣
This movie better not be reviewed by “White Dudes”, especially in their forty’s. Am I right Brie Larson?
yeah punch the justice into that old woman, show crime who's boss xD
i have a crush on her but she has no feelings bcz she smacked that poor grandma
Granny - you should have aimed for the leg.
No seat for you old lady.😂
No offence to Marvel fans( as I am one myself) but I smell a shitty movie.  It will be hard to follow up with something after infinity war.  I hope it does well, just I don’t think it will.
meh... looks exactly like another shitty agendadriven movie . not gonna pay for that .
I also hit old ladys!
2. The sound track ...it needs hans zimmer or some shit to give it more suspense..
Press f to pay respect to blockbuster video, the good old times
I wish that old lady is skrull.😂😂😂
When 👵 keeps talking shit about your life choices infront of you to your mom and acts like your not standing right there hearing that shit.
That Old Lady got smacked hard
I get the old lady is a Skrull.... but I also appreciate the trailer actually gives zero context for the punch at any point. So it's an old lady smiling at Brie Larson getting rocked. A+.
Man in AV4, she will be really old xD
Too bad its more fem bullshit
*hits grandma in the face*
v0.5 : Thanos is dead. Suspected-One hit kill by Captain Marvel
Script says, "punch the shit out of an old person". Captain Marvel says : "Learned it from Rosa Parks".
now they think getting thanos,  loki,  thor guardians of galaxy  is not enough but to bring  new girl is easy that is from outer space how the hell can they establish her appearence in avengers where ironman and captain america themselves are holding grudges like Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un
Punch old ladies!
Looked liked shit to me
She punched Hillary Clinton? This I have to see!
Was definitely the punching a granny part what made her a hero in my book. Dang those elderly people! :D
Punched an old lady like...
1:31 Zombies got my grandma....
Grandma Puncher will defeat Thanos? really? i mean, Really?
You know something is old when a Blockbuster store shows up.
Just punched the brains out of a random old lady
This is what I'd call an empty trailer. Sorry but except the violence against old ladies in the bus takin your sit, I don't see anything interesting
Carol punching the old lady was the best part
Finally a hero who isn't afraid of punching old ladies in the face!
rip granny on the bus 19xx-2018
*when capt marvel punched the old lady..  thanos felt it too🤩🤩💥*
Why did grandma get pimp slapped
Yooooo!!😮😮😮 She punched the shit out of that old lady 😂😂😂 (probably a Skrull, so it's cool lol)
"im not what you think I am" tell that to the bystanders who saw you smack the taste out of a "old lady's" mouth
"Discover what makes her a hero" Proceeds to punch an old lady
Shame on her she bitted a old lady.  😠😡.. Lamfo😄🤣
1:30 when there are raisins in grandma’s cookies
People have to understand 3 things about this trailer: 1. The reason Brie Larson is acting so straight faced is because her character is literally being brain washed. She has very little memory of her past life and so this practically makes her a robot, knowing only what she has been told and what she's experienced since getting her powers. 2. Kevin Feige has talked about this movie being like T2 and Top Gun, which explains the tone of this film. 3. Even though it says "Official Trailer", it plays alot more like a "Teaser Trailer". And if you think of the trailer in that way, it will become more enjoyable(?). Also, once you understand the fact of what is happening to Brie Larson's Carol Danvers, I think you can be more understanding of why her character has one face expression, and it will enhance the viewing of the trailer. I think alot of people watch trailers but don't really think. If you analyze the trailer and understand what is going on, it will be better for you.
8000 grandmas disliked the video
Damn, this movie looks like it’s going to be shit. Why is the trailer so bad? Ehh doesn’t matter I’m still going to watch it.
Who else came to she her hit the old lady from the memes
Captain marvel pinching that old lady seemed really funny out of context
What's made hero *punch old woman
Why she had to hit grandma
Fcking horrible. She looks like old woman
Damn that old lady got laid out!
And respects the shit out of that elderly
I don't dislike her because she is a female superhero, I dislike her because I expect her lines will be leftwing garbage and the movie will be about empowering woman and for some reason I expect this movie to end with her punching Donald Trump in the face, say something girl powerish and then roll credits.
Nice Super Hit Movie
Meanwhile on social media : "Crazy cosplayer girl just hittin grandma's ass"
Yo, what's up with punching the old lady?
I finally did it, I made it to a Marvel Trailer before It hits a million
She Hit That Old Woman Like Detroit Ho Owing Money To Mississippi Pimp
When grandma bakes her cookies wrong
looks like dog shit
Jesus, I can already see a bunch of people getting mad about the old lady scene cause they probably don't know what a skrull is.
A hero immediately shows her punching an old lady
Now this is my opinoin. I don't want any 9 year old marvel fan boys to come squeeze my balls...
Holy shit it’s a blockbuster store
Batman was punching grannys ten years before this.
1:30 the grandma :(
What a miserable looking "hero". Who punches an old lady on the bus? idiotic.
The old lady is a Skrull people.
Just placing this out there, remember the old lady (I forgot about her) Ya, don't watch the Aldo Jones weird trailer. like up so people can see. Jesus.
Captain Marvel: back in the days we used to slap old people...
Rip grandma 2018-2019
1:31 grandma I’m just sick pf you’re jokes
Why does she crack an old woman upside the head?? "The hero we've been waiting for!" Lol
What I if told you 
But she is white! How are they allowed to do this?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!1!!!oneoneone
No villain introduced, hits an old lady randomly with no hint given as to why, her voice is frankly uninspiring and bog standard. Thought I would be excited for this but this trailer was a letdown.
Holly shit! She's coming!
no trans whamen disabled person of color? yawn, smdh, what is wrong with you marvel, there's not enough trans disabled diversity, i need to see no white people too (that would help a lot those evil whitey's), now that is what i would call trans disabled diverse.
The grandma was one of the green dudes in disguise. The skrull ..
Look, I'm not saying grandma deserves it but she had it coming.
Good shit.... Hahah
What the hell she punch an old lady😂😂
That moment when you see nick fury😀, then you see Agent Coulsin😃 then you look at Agent Coulsin’s old haircut🤯
1:31 she just slapped the shit out of that poor lady XD
Captain Marvel:*punches grandma in face*
the old lady is skrull shapeshifting
Bruh stop commenting about her punching an old lady in the face ffs
Captain Marvel: *Punches*
Ok here we go, I knew people where going to point how she creamed an old lady in the face.
Did Grandma really deserve that?
Why she punched that *old woman* in the *face?* ( ◔ ʖ̯ ◔ )
holy shit she punched a grandma
Why the hell did she punch a old lady
okay, but like, was the grandma a Skrull?
1:33 omg poor old lady 😂
Why she gotta do the old lady like that tho 💀
Why that old lady got punched so hard????
She out here punching grandmas 😂
The old lady is the main villain. Her super power is being racist, smelling like pee and fare dodging.
Everyone who doesn't know about the skrulls just lost their shit about the old lady getting super bopped. Who am I kidding? I know she's a skrull and I still lost my shit! XD
Why she hit the old woman
why'd she punch the gramma
The punch on grandma was unnecessary kkkkkkkk
That old lady got smacked😂😂😂😂
The old lady punching scene will surely be a new meme.
Edit: Well holy shit, there's a bunch of fighting in the comments here. I just want to say that for example I find the Black Widow badass (I didn't want to trigger anyone, sorry), I just don't find this actor that "badass" + the trailer is quite bad imo.
MOOOOOOOOM why is this new super-heroine punching grandmas
XD she beat the dog shit out that old lady
That was 60% super man +30% Nick fury and 10% beating an old woman....
IMO the best way to handle Captain Marvel wold be that she's not THAT strong in a straight fight, she won't be fistfighting Thanos, but she has unique powers that, used correctly, can seriously level the playing field.
When she slaps the old lady 😂
WTF did grandma do
Oh shit goosebumps.
Nick Fury: it's just an old lady
Trailer sucked, the movie might be good tho. The bullshit comes in when they say SHE is going to be the one to beat Thanos which is complete bullshit because ADAM WARLOCK is the character originally the one that did it.
I love how Carol just decks that old lady in face. Obviously it’s a skrull, but what if it wasn’t?
guys brie larson punched a grandma
............shit now I bummed myself out.
*beat up an old lady*
Captain Marvel: I'm Into granny's
Punching old women in the face now Capt?
That old lady is a SKRULL!! 😠
She punched an old lady HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
pls dont me a feminist shit movie.. just a normal superhero movie.
1:31 When grandma makes oatmeal raisin instead of chocolate chip...
Why she punched grannyyyyyy lmao
1:30 Okay kids dont hit grandma
grandma:yes!
Fun isn’t one considers while balancing the universe, but punching grandma’s, does put a smile on my face😀👍
I hope the Movie flops so hard that all of those Who helped makin this Shit Movie lost their Jobs. Phukkin Weirdos
Nick fury: We have no idea what threats are out there.. *Captain Marvel punches old lady* smh... I'm so underwhelmed.
Holy shit she's awesome
Why does captain marvel punch an old lady
Just came for the grandma
Spoiler alert: grandma is Thanos
*Instantly punched grandma*
Bruh did she just sucker punch an old lady
OK you guys just so yall know this movie is only for captin marvel to blend in with marvel and other heros this is basically a backstory and no there will not be a hint of infinity war 2 maybe because first of all look at nick fury so definite no because thats his old look there will be most likely a captin marvel part 2 maybe to continue but lets just hope SHE CAN SAVE MY BABY SPIDERMAN
All introductory superhero seem to be white...
this shit is about to snap
There's almost no built up or punctuation. It's caught me off guard, just like that old lady.
Why punch granny?
The old women who was hit by Captain Marvel is the scrull.
Damn she just punched an old lady.
Awsome super hitt
Punched old lady in her shit
Shut up grandma
Will Captain Marvel punch Stan Lee in the face too?
why she ppunsh old lady 
Ok sure... Let's punch old people.
Granny got whipped
I dunno shit bout CM, But arent the Kree, Or Skrulls, Or whatever there called from the Andromeda galaxy?
WTF she hit an old lady is that what i saw
1:31 Grandma: Have you finished your homework sweety?
That shot would be more funny if that old lady was actually human instead of a skrull
What a brat, slapping old ladies in the public transport! Is this the role model Marvel wants us to give to our little girls?
Song nameeee 😁 And wow I think hairy nick F  made white wifes boned 🤣🤣
1:30 FINALLY! This movie is truly about equality. We get a female hero so it's no longer sexist AND she punched an old lady so it's no longer ageist! Fight equality FTW!!!
Indians hit like!!👇👍
Most exciting thing in this trailer was her punchin' that grandma from The Visist. Lmaoo
1:32 Man, the way she punched that old lady
Think that old lady is a skrull
No one going to talk about that she just punch a old lady?
What a shit actress
she punched meemaw
This movie's finna be lit holy shit I can't wait
But when a person who knows nothing about the Skrulls or what they can do sees this trailer their reaction would be like “Who is this hero punching people?” I find this hilarious 😂
When she punch the Old Lady 😂😂
She Punched a grandma
The *hero* we never knew we needed..  To punch all these annoying ass elderly people
At 0:39 Nick Fury is on the left holding an ice pack over his left eye, the eye he loses.
Edit: and that old women she smacked was the real villain.
another politically correct NA shit
Holy mother friggin shit 🔥🔥🔥
That's a good trailer, and holy shit did she just go Binary!?
This looks like dogshit.
why with the grandma thoooooo
I guess this is before Fury had to wear an eyepatch? Especially since Carol Danvers (that is Captain Marvel’s name, right?) was wearing a SHIELD hat and was in the old headquarters from The Winter Soldier. They got blown up so it has to be before then and cursed Thanos’ arrival.
Grandma Skrull had it coming...
Spoiler alert- Turns out she spends the whole movie going around punching random old ladies and kicking puppies.
Captain Marvel: Yes Please! *takes a bite*  These are raisins! *punches grandma*
Mehhh.........boring trailer with unnecessary loud sound. Still believe a Thanos background movie before Avengers4 would have been better than this shit.
Those who disliked shows the respect of old people
1:46-1:48 Holly shit! 😱😱😍😍
She just punched an old lady. The old lady might be a Skrull.
1:28 a hero that...punch an old woman
Why did she punch an innocent grandma on the subway.
the super villains in this movie is the skrulls why else would she punch an old lady in the face. it could be the start of the initiative
Marvel shit again
That grandma sucker punch was the best scene 😂😂😂😂
Hope skrulls dont look as shitty as they do now
This is gonna be flaming trash just like every comic Carol Danvers has been in since the 80s. Way to choose the least likable heroine in your entire roster. Maybe she can arrest some innocent people and put Stark in a coma again? Or we could just throw in Immortus and really have a shit show.
Granny - "Heh, so you think you look all sexy in that fancy suit little girl?"
1:31 - when grandma wants you to take another bite.
Why did she punch that poor grandma?
She just hit a grandma? wtf??
Something tells me that Grandma was not an innocent old lady...
We didnt ask for this shit
You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself punching an old lady in the face
When you ask grandma not to put raisins in the cookies, but she puts them in anyway.
 People are pointing out how similar this looks to DCs sadly failed first attempt at green lantern, and I can kinda see that. Just seem a bit if a basic trailer with no real WOW moments. The grandma bit isn't that amazing at all, it's pretty obvious she's a skrull or some other villain so not really a big WOW there, and I'm guessing that's why it was In the trailer. Yes she doesn't look super amazing as Captain marvel at first, but it's their adaptation of her, and im excited to see how she plays her. I'm more impressed about how young they made Jackson look, takes me back to pulp fiction days lol
She give Granny a smack
SLJ looking damn fine for a 70 year old
die music after 1:45 makes me want to hit my head with the beat
1:35 communicator from Infinity War. Also for those confused by the old lady thing, I'm pretty sure she's a skrull.
She can't even leave old Granny
1:31 when your grandma has a phone and doesn’t remember her wifi password.
Apparently people are more curious about the grandma than the movie.
idk guys, this seems pretty shit
Finally!! Woah is that nick fury? Damn nick still looks old hahah jk...
Sometimes grandma has to get those hands
Ok I'm sure we all know that old lady is a skrull but come on out of context that looks funny as hell
SPOILER !!!!! that old lady is a shapeshifting skrull ! She was really punching a creepy alien
Grandma : I will act better than you  in just one second screentime, Wooden Face!
Dudee did she punched an old lady or its just me??
The lady captain marvel punched is a skrull.!
when you know that she is your stepmoms that your dad never told you!!
So its ok for a women to punch a grandma.....???????...Maybe a Skrull I don't know.
So are we to assume that the old lady she punches is the antagonist?
Captain marvel 2019 gone be hit 3 billion.
Hopefully Brie shows a little more emotion in the movie.  Seems a little cold.  Fingers crossed.
1:30 "we have no idea what threats are out there" *shows old lady smiling (probably a skrull)*
And iiiimm skipping this shit
I bet that Granny is a Skrull 👽
When I'm done no granny's will exsist
Capt. Marvel punches Aunt May from Toby Spiderman, jumps into the MCU.
All kerela marvel fans hit like  here
Unfortunatly, I'm still an old DC fanboy getting used to the fact that Shazam can somehow introduce himself without turning back into a boy.
I'll wait until I've seen it before deciding that the movie is shit or miscast or not...
This shit bout to blow up
Ok trailer but that poor old lady .... must be thanos in a wig
1:31 Granny Goodness confirmed.
A female version(not really)of One Punch Man? Hell yeah :p We need him to stop Thanos
Şehitler ölmez vatan bölünme❤
1:31 when grandma tries to kiss u on the mouth
like to pay respect to grandma
When an old woman creepily offers you candy. 1:39
While everyone's talking about the Grandma I'm thinking about the fact that Coulson was in the Trailer. I MEAN PLEASE TELL ME THAT COULSON IS GONNA ACTUALLY BE IN THE MOVIE. I am only season 2 of Marvels Agents of Shield but I would love to see Coulson show up in another movie!
That old lady must be one of the skrulls who can shape shift
People will meme the old lady
0:08 my grandpa told stories about this place. Didn't believe that it was real.
The text of what makes her a hero and then not 5 seconds later she punches an old lady
*Looks at old 70s Ms. Marvel comics and sobs
I bet ya that old lady is a Skrull
So we not gon talk about how she just Ray Rice’d that old lady
I don't know. I think it was all the hype surrounding when the trailer will drop, but this felt kind of okay. I love some of the editing and I'm sure the movie will be a hit, but this trailer felt off. Or maybe it's me? Who tf knows?
Shit! This is the marvel version of green lantern
She punches the old lady because she’s a skrull
When she sucker punched that old lady in the face i had to laugh.
Damn this looks waaaay better than dcs shitty shazam film.
A hero *dishes a right hook to smiling granny
she almost killed the old woman. (SPOILER)
What kind of lame shit is that? This trailer is boring I thought that captain marvel was going to appear on infinity war 2 not some spin off ass origin story just to bait us and get more money while delaying the part 2
That grandma she punched is gonna be thanos when avenger 4 comes out
1:31 🤣🤣🤣 she punched and old lady skrull
My grandma is my superhero
1:30 poor granny :(
0:38 So Nick Fury is holding a blue bag which looks like a ice bag, I guess he lost his eye there
1:30 When the old lady in the bus tell me to get off my backpack cuz she doesn't have enough space. Then me 1:31 .....
Why the heck she slap the old granny?
Finally we get Skrulls in a live action movie,Marvel Studios you just made my dreams come true,damn Captain Marvel was savage punching that skrull who disguise as an old lady in that train.😎😎😱😱
*proceeds to punch an old woman*
(Pig wants to get to live to 1000 years old)
Punching that old lady in the face is hilarious!
more feminist cgi lacking of history shitty movie
So how old is she?she doesn't get old like Wolverine?
Did she literally just hit that grandma. Damn the 90s are insane.
0:07 Blockbuster Video Store!! Hitting the Nostalgia Button!!
Yeah, y punch da old lady tho
As an old Marvel fan I will say one thing.
*Actual footage of me slapping the grandma who made this trailer*
1:31 falcon punch!
She punched tf outta that grandma
There is only one captain..he is captain america...not some overpowered white hot chick with same facial expression..
What if that old lady she punched.. turned out to be just an old lady and not a skrull..?
Legit just gonna watch the movie to see the old lady get punched
Now all I have to do is sit back and watch all the white knights complain about how the main character is a female and it’s promoting empowerment despite it being  canon.
Djimon Hounsou who plays Korath the Pursuer in Captain Marvel plays the old Shazam dude in the new Shazam! movie.
The suit looks like shit.
Felt bad for the old woman though
That poor old lady is probably dead
Punches old lady at 1:30
Everybody is saying that the Grandma is actually a skrull.. yeah I see that.. but what if it's actually played off ad a joke in the movie that she accidentally punches an old lady suspecting her of being a skrull... Hmmmmmm
Marvel keeps trying to shove this lame character in our face because LOL WOMEN HAVE CHARACTERS then the book fails, now this movie will fail. She is a boring character, please retire her. Almost any other character is better. We should've got Black Widow or Scarlet Witch film before this shit.
Non marvel fans be like "Why did she punch that old lady?"
But That Grandma.... SHE IS NOT A HERO
1:28 She deadass just punched an old woman 😂
Holy Shit...WW never gave me an adrenaline rush like this....so exited.
Why o why Grandma! Such a beautiful smile @1:30
She punched an old lady. Im on board.
*When people talk shit about a movie*
that old lady has to be a skrull
This is a teaser not an official so that's why theirs no action and plus it's not even 2019 so I rather not be shown epic shit and be spoiled
*Captain Marvel punches an old woman*
We will still have to wait 6 months to witness a grandma getting punched by Cap Marvel.
Holy shit. Brie Larson looks so good in this role. ❤️
That punch to the face of that old woman was awesome 😂
The old lady resembled my mother in law.
I think it’s pretty obvious that the old lady is a skrull
Winter Soldier: Deceased (unknown cause)
This trailer was so boring that the only thing people are talking about is Captain Marvel hitting that grandma.
7)Why the hell she punched that old woman ?🤔
That old lady punch tho, wow
this movie looks like shit! 
I pretty sure that the grandma is a skrull
AWESOME, CAN'T WAIT! I'd see the whole movie just to see why she's sucker punching the old woman lol🤔
1:31 i think that's skrull thats why she punched her ! Even thanos didnt do that!😂
1:30 Grandma Complains  about Trailer
Damn skrulls acting like old lady’s
Looks kinda lame. Also everyone who doesnt know about skrulls gets confused by the punching an old lady part lol.
That punching nanny scene will become a new marvel meme.
Carol, if you're punching old people anyway, I know one 72 year old who REALLY needs a dose of humility.
Smacks granny in the face.
1:30 my god! that old lady.. might be the skrulls.
but i don't like when she punches an old lady...ouhhh, sorry,.,it looks savage 😐
First off she gets her powers from the original Captain Marvel who was a dude....and he was powerful .....one of her powers is a sixth sense basically like spider man but with time. These stories are old..remember they were comics first people....Movies take out facts just to entertain you bitches.
haha sickk old lady punch 1:30
R.I.P. Random Grandma.
That shit is fire
*That grandma took the captain seat*
So let me get this straight, this is the first trailer that we've gotten of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel and everyone is already shitting bricks about the movie because they think Brie's acting is uncharismatic and plane? How is that a solid excuse to trash a movie? Also, since when did everyone become professionals with casting and directing?
In 2019 my birthday party will be better than this shit.
Brie Larsson punches old women confirmed.
Who else went straight to comment section the second they saw that grandma get punched?😂😂😂
That old lady with her knitting needles sitting there...menacingly 👊
holyyyyyyyyy shitttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt i am a DC fan but this is epiccccccccccccccc.. cant wait to watch it
Holy shitttt(spiderman).....😂
*plot twist:* turns out granny is thanos 1:31
she just punch an old lady wtf
CM flies, she’s super strong, she manipulates energy, she’s heroic ... but Marvel is more interested in showing you Samuel Jackson’s cgi mug. This trailer fucken sucks!!  and all you Disney cool aid drinkers don’t know shit about truly awe inspiring superhero movies. You all just want to giggle. Idiots!
The Blockbuster scared the shit out of me
OMG , that old lady like my grandma 😥
1:30 -"Is that the last donut with red, white and blue sprinkles?"
Thanos wipes out half the universe while captain marvel wipes out half the universe's grandmas.
I honestly didnt like the grandma slap she was so innocent that wasnt needed💔love to the elderly
She beat up an old lady.
1:30 oh look, a nice old lady, I'm just gonna  *P U N C H  Y O U  I N  T H E  F A C E*
Anyone that's still asking questions about why she punched the old lady is simple she was a SKRULL
Kree tech? Faulty memories? Does anyone else feel like maybe she took a trip to Tahiti?
Hyped up! Also are we not gonna talk about her knocking the old lady out?
She punched that grandma!!!
That skrull storyline is going to hold this movie together methinks, the group of actors looks laughably weak
I do not support old people abuse 😕
I wonder why grandma slammed her face on Captain Marvel’s fist how rude
Dude, her acting seems flat as shit... Let's hope she doesn't do a blank stare during the entire movie.
Thanos will shit his pants
Oh shit Dorris got twated
Except the girl whole trailer is nothing more than a shit
The part where she hits that old lady gives me flashbacks to hot fuzz
but Captain Marvel is busy in hitting Grandma !*
Oh damn shits going down.
pretty sure grandma is a skrull.
Yeah, but I'm a white man and Brie Larson doesn't care what I think so why should I go see her movie?
The old lady lady is a skrull. Either that or captain marvel made a very bad mistake XD.
Truth be told I was ready to hang it up, til I met you today. 
looks great aside from the pc bullshit
Okay, this looks dope as shit. I was iffy about it before I saw the trailer because I literally know nothing about the character. But it looks good.
Yay shitloads of new memes
mcu biased people(grandma): tom holland is the best spiderman of all time
Did u see her beat up that old lady like I beat my meat
Indian Fans hit like👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I rather a shitty trailer and an amazing movie than a amazing trailer and shit movie... Sucide squad anyone?
pg 18 because of violence against old people
her punching that old lady is me when there are no seats on the bus. sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do
This is a REALLY cool trailer and whatnot but one thing that really bugs me is Whether we wanted it or not we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
Marvel : punching an old lady in the face.   lol wtf was that
oh shit. she punched an old lady
1:30 YEAH! SMACK that granny harder!
does being the strongest superhero means you can punch an old lady in the face 🤔 hmmmmmmm
Supremely generic. Brie is too good for this shit.
I feel like the 1st Venom trailer to be honest (the 1 where they didnt show Venom for some stupid reason and it got downvoted like shit for it). I mean all we wanted was to see Captain marvel's POWERS! If shes the best thing to stand against Thanos, she needs some real power - not glowing stuff, but combat with the powers: evasive flight maneuvers (her's not some plane's), more energy beams that look good, etc.
Captain Marvel punching grandmas everywhere coming soon.
Punching grannies on a subway? Must see
She punches an old lady right, i saw that didnt i?
That old lady got the smack down on her.
Take this grandma
Did she slap an old lady with no provocation
That old woman was a Skrull but most people won’t guess that. Placing that scene right after calling Captain Marvel a hero was blatantly retarded.
here is my comment. hate the movie already, but I am going to see it just because of Avengers. And after the next Avengers movie. I will be done with it all. Disney/Marvel have ruined everything and are continuing to blame White males for the problems of the world. I'm done.
I want Hulk to beat the shit outta thanos,  not herrrrr
when will stop this superheroes movies bullshit. i personally dont see one in years. will gladly skip this one too.
Captain Marvel: Hold My Beer :)
Wow!! When I saw Captain Marvel's mask, I say this is gonna be a Box Office Hit for Marvel again and for legendary Stan "The Man" Lee
Im just gonna watch this movie because she hit a granny and I need to know why.
she gonna punch thanos as hard as she punched the old lady
what the reason to punch that old lady!?!?!?!?!?!? 🤣🤣🤣
Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit
Alright y'all wanna tell me why she just decked a granny in the face?
So Old Ladys are Skrull? All of them? Because i helped one over the Street today. If only i knew...
*Punches old lady.*
All heros should punch old ladies its the bew style!!!
When ya grandma comments on your ripped jeans 1:30
Move aside boys Captain Marvel is here to get shit done
Maybe all skrulls look like old ladies.....
Same old story.
that poor granny...
Captain America:Winter Soldier
Why does he punch old Lady
Hoooly shit I've been waiting so long to see this.
this hit me in the feels
Did she just smack a granny ? Damn carol
I liked when she punched the tar outta that old lady ( 1:30 ).
That Grandma getting hit is about to be a meme calling it now
Ugh... When will this shit end.
thanos changed his gender into granny infinity stones  long live
Lol hero saves the day from grandma
soooo, this is the savior that's gonna beat the shit outta thanos? i approve
Did I just see Phil Coulson, I thought he was living it up in Tahiti. guess he got bored of Melinda May XD
I'm 64 yrs old and grew up on 12cent marvel comics. Marvel and Stan Lee should be ashamed on how they butchered stories and characters from the Marvel universe. This one's on my must miss list along with ant man and the wasp.
Captain Marvel in movie: Punches grandma
I just hope shes not as annoying as she is in the comics, mainly referring to civil war 2, also i’m pretty sure she punches that old lady because she’s a skrull.
Did she just punch an old...
*Hit Like For Marvel*
So I'm curious as to why Marvel chose a racist, sexist actress to portray their lead in this movie. I mean if we are all about equality these days, should she not be held to the same standard as every other ass clown that has had their career's destroyed for being a racist sexist POS? Ohhhhh right. We aren't about equality, we are about favoritism and live in a society where the only acceptable form of discrimination is against white men. Good job Marvel. Yes yes, "TRIGGERED!" White fragility, blah blah blah.
Damn, she hit a grandma.
Holy shit. The last powering up part gave me chills
The granny was a skrull
punches old lady in the face😂😂
Mk so eiether the old lady is a skrull or ..... captain marvel is an og lmao
*Thanos is shitting himself rn.*
Meanwhile... the DCEU continues to shit the bed.....
Poor grandma jeez
At the cover an innocent face but in the trailer that very same lady banging the old lady face that is so horrible
So the story of  how he lost his eye may be told in this movie.
*punches old woman in the FACE* 
Looks like nothing. Nothingness personified in a film. What a stale genre this shit has become.
discover what makes a hero.————punches an old lady in the face
1:30 Did she really punch an old lady? I guess Walt Disney now endorse abusing the elderly.
That old lady she punched was a skrull 😂😂
I don't know why everyone is talking about the old lady, but BLOCK BUSTER IS STILL A THING!?
*shows scene of her punching an old lady*
I cant wait for this move, but honestly the trailer was holding back a lot. People anticipated this for weeks. No major cameos other than Sam J? Still going to see this.
10 year olds: what's a blockbuster?
The old lady is a Skrull people, that's why she decked it in the face.
the skrull maybe change thier body ..if it is right it is nice and old lady maybe one skrull and captain marvel detect it
Wish I could do that to my grandma🤧
This trailer looks so shitty! Im still hyped because its marvel though.
but because i`m curious about the gandma getting hit
Grandma : MGK
*punches old lady in the face
Lmao just came here to watch that old lady get punched
punching old lady , wow have respect lady !!
Holy shit, I'm not surprised to see her Binary form, but I really wasn't expecting the Kree helmet and mohawk!
1:31 What a punch!
Just a theory but maybe that grandma is an alien in a disguise? 
Respect your elders don’t punch them.
the first 15 seconds was comedy gold. im sold
Grandma getting punched is probably a new meme.
1:30 Makes me feel so sad and guilty inside when she punches the old woman... (;-;)
oh no not this kind of shit!
No disrespect.... but this shit look weak af
Well a granny on a train is one
This movie will worth be seeing only for alien old lady shapeshifter punching
Why did she punched the old lady😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Punched the grandma!!!!   ...sneaky skrull no doubt
Now I’m interested even more in this movie just to figure out why captain marvel hit a old women
That old lady is a formshifter
Did she knock down that old lady? 😂
Jokes that looks shit
She Punched her  👀
Damn she just straight up decked that old woman tho
That punch to the old lady was fookin nice.
Why did she punch the granny😱
The old lady is a skrull😂
Hope that old lady that she slugged was really a Skrull. If not... oops.
Lmao she just jaw jacked an old lady
Really, no one is going to talk about how Captain Marvel just socked some old woman in the face? 1:30
The scene where she punches a Skrull posing as an old lady is priceless 😂
She seems fitting for the character, it's just gonna be a buzzkill to hear all the feminist bullshit thrown all over the place like this will be the first goddamn movie with a female lead ever in the history of cinema.
She looks like my ugly sister but older
Did she just punch an old lady in the mouth??
I love the part when she punched the Grandma 😂
That said, captain marvels tiddies could be bigger though. Also, did she really just punch out an old lady?! 😁
shit hero shit trailer bad movie
If u didnt know the old woman is a Skrull(Shapeshifter)
Finally a trailer that doesn't tell you shit about the movie.
She just falcon punched that only lady...
Did she just deck that grandma?
Hit like if you think u expeccted more from the trailer
why did she punch that old woman?!seriously...why?!
P.S: dislike for hitting grandma
1:30 Just casually beating on a old women (but i seriously thinks that is a Skrull)
I swear if she just shows up and is stronger than Thor ima flip my shit
1:30 Punches an old lady...
D-Did she just punches an old woman in the face!!?
omg she punched a granny lollll
Captain Marvel: *Hits Grandma.
HEY! What did that old lady do to you?!
when grandma takes back your cookies 1:30
That old lady is skrull i think......
When you get pissed at grandma 1:30
Holy shit it looks awesome and why skrulls looks same as first look
Grandma:shdjdjejhdbdjiwosow
R.I.P. MCU. This looks really boring. The actress looks the same in every shot. I miss the old days.
3. You can not breath while holding your tongue out 
Who else is excited to see this movie just to know why she punched the old lady in her grill?
Thanos Car: Hold my oil.
Punches Grandma, def taking down Thanos😭😂😂
Dat low bitrate grandma mixed it... -_-
holy shit i am totally watching this
This trailer tells me nothing about the character, or theme of the movie. The only things I can discern from this are: Brie Larson can't act and the CGI is probably going to be shit. 
Holly shit !!!!
1:31 You just punched an old lady.. man what kind of hero are you!!
I think it's shitty.
Did she just sock that old woman in the face?! 1:30
You better hit that dislike button...
I wasn't as hype for this movie till I saw captain marvel punch that old lady in the face
RiP Granny
All these people confused as to why she hit an old lady need to pick up a comic.
The Marvel Studio's logo was gold tho :/
I like the grandma 👵
I if avengers 4 affects look like this I’ll be pissed. After avengers 4 the Mcu will probs go to shit anyways
Look, trailer is all cool and shit, but if she is the one who defeats thanos, im outta there, cause i like this hero, but her coming over to avengers movie outta nowhere to defeat thanos seems kinda lame tbh
That “old lady” is a skrull. Or Captain Marvel is a skrull...
That old lady was a skrul thats why she punched her..!👊👊
Well hot damn, I'm sold.
* punches the shit out of an old lady *
I'll bet that old lady was a skrull lmao this is going to be good
Grandma: smiles
Can we change her name to Captain grandma puncher?
man, I was on board until shit beat the shit out of that happy old lady on the bus... nah, I don't care, give me another Marvel movie!
The movie looks pretty cool from this trailer. If this movie is handled properly in the same way that "WonderWoman" was then it will be good. Just please no feminist propaganda bullshit.
Carol:  Oh hell no! Not in my movie b$%&/! *punches face*
Wow, SOmeone told she's gonna move planets 
There must be someone else in disguise of grandma..that's why she punched her.
If this girl doesn’t impress the fans pander to shitty people... we will boycott this movie...
1:31 grandma doesn't feel so good
*No old ladies were harmed in the makimg of this movie*
She just punched an old lady.. huh
I think the reason not a lot of people are sold is because they are just playing super epic music over some pretty standard looking shots and Larson talking, for the most part, pretty monotone. She's a good actress so it's probably more fitting for the scene they took it from, but it isn't trailer worthy.
Okay.that was just an old lady smiling.:(
I hope the grandma beats up Captain Marvel
YO! She just punched some old lady!
Hit like if you too want it on trending # 1 
Watch as her smacking the old lady becomes a meme or maybe it already is.
A true hero punches an old lady👊
1 like = 1 punch in the head
why did she hit an old lady? Lol
She's far too ugly for this movie to be a hit.  Why did they pick such an ugly actress?  Let's be honest, the reason wonder woman was such a smash was the main lead was ridiculously hot - women liked the "girl power" message and the guys drooled over her.  Win win.  But this person looks disgusting - please recast!
Can't wait to watch it and find out why she punched an old lady LMAO
*punches ur nan*
Did she just fckin hit that granny?
That old lady you punched had to be a skrull
Slapping old ladies
when grandma forgets to send you your birthday money 1:31
I really like that killing grandma part. I feel it's heroic. I will try it too.
She punched the highlights out of Nanas hair.
This Does Put A Punch on My Face - Grandma
Punching an old woman in the face?? That's a paddlin' ...
am i the only one who repeated that scene where grandma get punched? 😂
The problem here is that both the trailer and the actress are boring for lack of a better word. The trailer has no substance, no energy. When the Thor Ragnarok trailer came out it was like a party with good music and a fun attitude. Being that this takes place in the 90's I want to see more than just a Blockbuster and a Nine inch nails T-shirt as a reference. If they would've played some music like White Zombie it would've definitely changed the vibe. And as for Bri Larson she just comes off as one note. Even the expression on her face barely changes through the whole trailer and the dialogue was really flat. Hopefully I'm wrong and the next trailer will be better.
She almost knocked grandma's head off (take notes THOR)
I came here cause of the" punch old lady scene"
Is she gonna save the universe with punching an old women WTF
Why tf she punch the shit outta my NaNa though?
Atleast show a skrull for a second or something (old woman does not count). Not showing one is pure stupidity cause without one of them this trailer is extremely underwhelming and they are a major reason why people want to see this movie. We’ve literally seen everyone in this movie already in multiple films excluding CM and honestly not that many people are excited for her, it’s the skrulls they came to see.
1:30 when your grandma wins the lottery
Captain marvel will be be a major part of the avengers and the old lady of course
Grandma got punched. Shapeshifter?
I was sold at 'BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO'
Look's like shit.
The old lady was a skrull. A shape shifting alien species and empire from the Comics.
She just destroyed that old woman
75% She just punched an old lady 
A human being imbued with goddess-like super powers. Marvelously exceptional!!! Another blockbuster hit from MCU.
y'all talkin about grandma... but what about blockbuster video
All of the dislikes are by old ladies
I liked the old ironman ganre way more than this thanos aids
Everybody thats saying this is weak is ignoring the fact that skrulls are about to be revealed to the mcu...shits about to get real
When Brie Larson punches a grandma you know shit just got real
That intro hit me hard.
Y did she punch that old lady 😢
Basic white gi-- I mean.. captain Marvel. Coming to theatres
When she hit the old lady it reminded me of when Dean threatened to stab the old woman in the neck because he knew it was a shapeshifter 😂😂
1:31 why did she hurt the old women
This look like shit.
This shit looked like a Netflix show trailer.. with Kristen Stewart levels of acting in the main character
I love the MCU however this looks shit
Please tell me the old lady she punched was really a Skrull
Marvel you can’t hit me with that Blockbuster callback.
66K DC fanboys hit the thumbs down. It hurts we know. THIS is a real flying hero and her mom’s name isn’t Martha.
Couldn't stop laughing when she smacked the old lady 😂😂
So she was a pilot in the nineties,has some kind of problem and ends up off world where she meets jude law "captain marvel" and is  enhanced, looses her memory  and ends up fighting the kree...she persues a kree ship to earth and crashes into a block busters and goes on a rampage taking out under cover kree"ie punching the old lady on the bus also oher kree that are also on earth. That's when nick fury meets her and her wants to know how she is and that she is a AWOL pilot that went missing and needs to know what other threats are out there .....  No need to thank me my brother had some info from a guy a pine wood and explained it to me ..
....did she just knockout an old lady?
why would she punch a inoccent old lady
What if captain marvel was mistaken that the old lady isn't a skrull after all
OH Yeah! I am super pumped to watch this movie after she punched that old lady, Marvel really knows what their audience wants.
They really didnt show off any of her talent for this trailer. Just stale lines..regardless, I need to see Carol punch that old lady.
Really did not excpect her to punch an old lady tbh
Old lady: shazam is the original capta-
This actress literally looks like super girl but older and in a different outfit. This BETTER not be like super girl, or I will not watch.
Those who are showing their concerns towards the old lady, she must be a skrull😂😂
2018 taking on thanos 2019 taking on old ladies
If not for other (obvious) reasons , I'll surely go and watch this to know why she hit that grandma at 1:31 atleast for sure..😂😋
Shitttttttttttttttt.........we need CAPTAIN "D" right now, so fuckin hungry
Ryan Reynolds is the best person to wear the green suit uniform
The average movie goer don't know who the skrulls are, so they just think she punched an old lady for nothing
Um so we gonna ignore the fact that she slapped a old wine at 1:31
damit now I need to watch this movie cause I wanna know what happened to grandma
When Grandma tries to give you some hard boiled sweets 1:30
　Hopefully I'm wrong and she's a likeable character with balanced powers, but so far it's meh. The trailer doesn't nearly have me sold.
She just punched an old lady in the face!!! Now I'm definitely watching this movie!
Wtf did she sucker punch grandma for??😂😂
"I'm not what you think I am " *Punches Old Lady*
If u also think se is dam hot and sexy hit a like
1:31 the Grandma got knocked the fu** out lol
Epic trailer horrible movie...just a guess...i don't get why she hit her
Looks cornier than my shit after the 4th of july.
Did she just smashed an old lady ?
Did I just see her punch a gramdma? 😂
Going to be biggest hit in this year !
Nibba punch an old lady wtf
Kree-Skrull War, Ronin the Accuser, Mar-vel, Nick Fury, Phil Coulson, Binary form of captain marvel. What else are you expecting from 100 seconds video. And if you think this is bad, then go and watch JL. You deserve that Shit.
Old Lady: *smiles*
The old lady is a Skrull I bet
Uhmm sorry did i just saw she punched an old lady?
Why do she punch that granny 😫
Did that old lady get popped
Omg, why she slap granny? Why dont use Over Power Ultra Beam Cosmic Power 1:30
Another hit from marvel
captain bulshit marvel this time make me dawn
1:30 When grandma gives you clothes for your birthday
Why did they spend ten years developing all these characters to face Thanos just to release this movie as her being the big hero of the day and she’s gonna defeat thanos. Why are you doing that Marvel? We aren’t sexist we just wanna see the characters we give a shit about win, not the ones we don’t.
Brie is a soft cow's-milk cheese named after Brie, the French region from which it originated. It is pale in color with a slight grayish tinge under a rind of white mould..... sounds about right 😂😂😂
She punched an old lady. Sold. Im in.
Smacking grandma 👵🏻 because the cookies 🍪 sucked 1:30
I never cared for the actresses but this gets me pumped for the next Avengers movie! Because im sure Thanos is going to beat the shit out of her before they mcguffin him away.
XD, she just hit that lady like she was a criminal. LOL
Goddamn it she punched an freaking old lady who was *smiling* at her okay i srsly wanna know why now, i don't _think_ she goes around punching old people
50% comments: "a hero, punching old lady"
*shows clip of her punching an old lady*
Hold up hold up hold up.....i need to watch this on my laptop.
What a good first trailer. Who else watched this more than five times before this hits 1 million views?
The trailer is meh, I was pumped for this. But I think I know the reason why the old lady got punched, because she might be one of the Skrulls.
🤷🏽‍♂️... I guess...was expecting much more.. truth be told..it looks boring
Looks like dog shit honestly
She's not the girl you met on Tinder...she puts on make-up to repel white men...her power grows with each menstrual cramp, she's....Captainnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn Marvelllllllllllllllllllllll
Blockbuster? Now you know this shit old school.
This looks shitty and the actress is very boring... Not a good pick!
First time that I see a blonde punch a granny woman
1:31 Punching Old people. This the low level Marvel is willing to go.....
So we gon act like she didnt just smack that sweet old grammy.
That poor old woman
This will be shit yet will have 7.5 score just like black panther.
This managed to NOT get me excited at all. Sorry to all you 12 year old MCU fans, but it wasnt a great trailer.
Oh man i hope this ends up being different. Looks shit
Y’all got proof the granny was a skrull? No so shut up
1:30 when your grandma says LISTEN TO YOUR MOM
Same shit as always
What if that old woman is one above all??
the old lady was like
Curious to know if a majority of the people that don't think this trailer is good are just manchildren that don't know how to cope when a female superhero is superior to the male ones and doesn't flounce around in a frilly revealing outfit. Without Captain Marvel the Avengers stand no chance in beating Thanos... like seriously look up what she is credited with having abilities of just from her appearances in comics. Get over the fact it's not some buff white guy leading a film and who will most likely defeat Thanos and save all of the Avengers. 
Captain America said “I’ll sock ol’ Hitler on the jaw!”
Did she just punch an old lady in the metro for smiling at her?
Does Thanos' grandma deserve that smacking??
I'm pretty sure she had a good reason to punch her...
I lost someone I cared about more than anything in 2008. It's been a long road but I told myself I'd dedicated my life to making music that would not only change the world but that would inspire whoever listened to change the world as well. If you're reading this and stopped through my channel to listen, thank you for supporting me. I know what it's like to feel like you're one voice drowned out by a million others. Together we really can make a difference. 😇😇 ❤️
1:31 when Grandma gets you an Xbox One game for Christmas but you have an Xbox 360
Meh still not sold
Ya cool but whyd she deck an old lady
*Punches grandma in the face traveling on a bus*
I know Carol Danvers has stepped it up recently when taking on the Captain Marvel title (vs. Ms. Marvel), but even back in the day I always felt she had more spunk than what was shown here.  Hopefully her actual lines have more punch to them in the final movie.
Who laid this shit burger?!?
So she will be in jail during infinity war time because of punching the old lady right?
The old lady is obviously a shape shifter. Y'all are slow. 😅
Punches an old woman - 'i need to see this movie now.'
That old grandma looks so lovely...
It's about time someone stood up to granny! Her cheek pinching days are OVER!
If it wasn't obvious, the old lady is a skrull
Real shit...  imma watch this when I get home from school
Is it just me or did I really saw her punch that old lady.
This shit will be the first fail marvel studios movie. Mark my words!
Holy shit, I'm so hyped!
When you read the comments and all you see is people talking about a grandma.
Man, Captain Marvel punching grandma skrull (on beat) is super funny.
It looks like shit
Hold up, was that bucket head?
Zero trailer crossed 50M views in 24hrs ..hit likes indians
Punching the elderly Ranking
Did she just punch the old lady ?
This shit gonna blow up in a matter of days
Yeah! Punch that old lady!!
That old lady probably deserved it
Grandma: DC is better than Marvel
Punched a old lady. Yeah I’m down for that.
Granny had it coming. Her knitting was way to loud.
I like how she punched that -old woman- shiet they a skrull _kill NOW_
maybe captain marvel ain't been around cos she's been in some kind of prison for fuckin yeeting an old lady that turned out not to be a skrull at 1:30
I like the part where she punches the old lady in the face.
She punched the old lady because she didn't thank the bus driver
Just imagine if the old granma wasn't a skrull. How do you recover from that? "Ups sorry, ma bad"?
Bruh she just punched an old lady😭
1:30 *Poor Granny*
She Punched The Old Lady Like How Thanos Punched Captain America
Did captain marvel just punched an old woman in the face??
Edit: for you that want to know why the old lady punched is bc shes a skrull
Did an old lady just get punched in the face on a train?
The women who gets hit is a scrull who is a shape-shifting alien. I think this movie is going to be abouy kree vs scrulls and captain marvels part in ending the war
Well this looks shit.
Is this the same actress who said that she doesn't care about the opinion of white dudes concerning this movie?
Shit! A Baywatch/Bold and beautiful style actress. Thor two, Captain America the first avenger lets hope this is not
Always that shitty sound in EVERY trailer.
A truthully self destruction of the gritty super hero topos and who knows - maybe an end to this shitty trend after all
I should have worn my white pants
The old lady looks like her
Anyway, still one punch man is the powerful one
The old lady was a Nazi. She'd just assumed Captain Marvel's gender. :)
So hold up.  Is that Blockbuster in Bend, Oregon?
Punch the fuckin granny
20% of "omg, poor old lady ..."
Big fan of the old lady punching...not that I would do such a thing
obviously the savior of humanity has to be a blond white chic......
1:30 when you wanna give granny a big fistbumb
Why does she look so cold, turn that frown upside down
punch grandma = the training needed to later kill Thanos.
Disappointed 😞 We want avengers to beat thanos not captain marvel 😑😑😑😑 shit..
1:32 When grandma buys you the wrong bionicle.
The music in this trailer hits home for me. From the blaring warning alarm followed by the piano intro (very nostalgic) to the strings in unison and brass adding weight. Everything building and pumping up until the orchestral voices kick in at the end.
the grandma is an alien and everyone will be shock except captain marvel
Holy Fuckin Shit.! Strongerst MCU Character!!
holy shit phils back can someone tell me why i thought loki killed him in avengers 1 let me guess he gets resusitated and why the helll does nick fury have hair lol okay okay this reminds me too much of man of steel he was born on krpton and gets sent to earth and joins the justice leauge i feel like they are copying man of steel com on MCU dont jugde me people but i think captain marvel isnt going to be good but im still going to watch it
bruh when i saw she hit a old lady i was like bruh
I'd love to see Thor/Cap/Tony/Hulk give Thanos the final beatdown. It would also be emotionally satisfying to have Thanos meet his end at the hands of Gamora or Nebula (who truly deserve to do it). It would be awesome to have Vision rebuilt and phase into Thanos and rip out his heart. It could be cool for Scarlet Witch to discover her immense power at the last minute and destroy him. It would be unequivocally moronic if Captain Marvel had the slightest thing to do with Thanos's defeat, or if she even steals a moment of glory from Rocket. Thanos's butt belongs to the REAL Avengers we've been following for the last 10 years, not for some D-list "GRL PWR" character who could never hold her own comic.
1:31 when she sees someone hit the dislike button
I think she just ended that poor granny's life.
This is going to be a hit
that old grandma is...
You just hit an old waman
This shit sucksss
the old lady is a skrull .... come on people heheheh reptilian  shapeshifting ?
Young capt thot puches old thot in the face!!! This is how heroes are born!!! Lettttttt's gooooo!!!!!!
Thor and Tony Still My Favorite. Hit like if think so
Indian. marvel. need. hit. like.
what kind of poopy shit is this
When she is done... Half of all the grandma’s will still be alive...
“F” to pay respect to the old lady
God I'm so hyped probably our only hope against thanos has arrived and lol that skrull as an old lady
But assaulting granny, bonus points for abusing old people.. WTF, so brave and heroic...
OMG, its Jules and Vincent except this time Vincent turned into a white woman.
Granny Norma
Also this is the second time I was here before a Marvel trailer hit 1M views
Feeling sad for old lady 😒
I wait too much.....day by day it get harder to hold on for this
I wonder if that old lady would've been worthy
She has to be from a gang to punch an old lady😂
Captain Marvel with mask/helmet looks cool otherwise looks shit to me.
Hide your grandmas cause they're punching everybody out here
Whats with hitting grandmas 🤔
Looks like shit, and I love marvel
I hope the AARP was on set to witness that poor old lady getting whooped on by Captain Marvel.
Lil'Old Lady: Thanos done nothing wrong
*punches her in the face*
Holy Shit! Did Captain Marvel just went Super Saiyan! Dayuuummm....🌋🔥
This Trailer is holding Back
Poor old woman :'c
Every one hates the trailer just cuz granny got punched in the face maybe granny is a scroll
looks like a worse green lantern xD  where's ryan reynolds?
The Farmer's Mother from Hot Fuzz thought she could avoid getting hit in the face by moving to the US
So everyone will ignore the fact that she punched an old lady at 1:30 😂
Punching an old lady? I'm hooked.
What a piece of shit
Even deadpool didn't punch old ladies in his movies lmao
Did she just punch a granny!
She shouldn't have hit thanos's grandma .
*punches like a little girl
She punch that ol lady because it is thanos  :v
11 male super hero movies in a decade all of a sudden 1 female superhero comes along and everyone looses there shit.
Lets be honest (even though you must be thinking this is copied, its not) we never liked this trailer except for the fact that she punched a grandma and the shot of her upside down were pretty much the only high quality Avengers Infinity War camera angle
When she punched that old lady tho😂😱
Granny:you have no ass
Marvel fans hit the like
1:30 old grandma (look a like) got punch in her cute little face
Holy shit!!!!!!!!!
This gets my like only for that grandma backhand
Did she just smack a grandma who just smiled at her...
… eeexcept, what did that poor old lady do to deserve a punch to the face??
Why did she hit that old lady at 1:31 ? Any theory ?
She is old than captain america?
Old lady: would you like a cookie
Şehitler ölm❤ 
*Hits the old lady*
The old lady must have dentures now
For everyone saying why she hit the old lady. ITS A SKRULL
Lmfao  that smack to the grandma came out of nowhere and made me laugh so hard
Hot damn! Btw the old lady is obviously an enemy in disguise... amazing trailer though
The part when she punched the lady made me sad but why?😯
She just punched an elderly lady in the face! WTF 😂 (I know it's out of context and the "old lady" is probably a Skrull but still, that scene was unexpected!)
This looks kind of shitty
Ill take 2 tickets to see a superhero punch an old lady! Thank you
Captain Marvel aka granny basher 👊
Nearly choked on my food when she punched the grandma.
1:31 What did she just punch her or grab her face?
Im also loving the Retro and Older look, the older Marvel Timeline set in earlier periods of times is going to be interesting to see. It's like going back to Captain America's Origins.
You Have to love this homemade Wow Wow... Story that to know, give your ration of gold.
Did she just punch that old lady??? 1:31
It looks so bad, I think it can beat black panther for worst mcu film (yes black panther was pure shit)
grandma beater 👀
Why am I not sold on this?
Wait. why she punch the old lady at 1:30?  now im curious because other than that this looks like a reverse green lantern movie.
Holy shit I'm happy Coulson is finally back
Slaps an old lady
She's literally punch that old lady...dammn capt
sick of this superhero shit!!!
Lol the old lady got no-scoped 😂
I just fear that the agenda being pushed will be done so hard, that it sticks in the throat a little. I'm cool with the MCU going in a new direction after Avengers 4 (I get it, it's their franchise) but I really wouldn't want to see Danvers coming in like an overpowered Mary Sue in A4 and saving the day from the redundant 'old guard' that are having their swan song and in which many fans are invested.
Punch an old lady 😦
Her punching the old lady made me want to watch this
didn't watch trailer. hit pause. Just wanted to say F U Marvel for screwing up everything.
Did she really punched that old lady?
I don’t mean to be a downer ,  but her acting his kinda shit
1:30 A sweet old lady? Get cho ass off of hia!
Punch the Grandma lmao
0:49 So an undercover secret agent tracking down aliens sounds familiar. White Light flashes.
Why is she doing the Kamehameha shit?
This movie scares me. It took them too long to make this trailer especially since they almost finished the movie by the time they made the trailer (which ironically they usually are only partly done with the movie when a trailer comes out). Not to mention the trailer they did make is mediocre at best and pandering at worst with the whole "her" message. We get it. Women can be superheroes. Stop trying to use feminism to sell your tickets, it's gross. I hope the film isn't a disaster that panders on the whole "women can be heroes" shit as the main theme. It's overplayed and it's 2018. We have had plenty of strong ass women already like Mystique, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Storm, Jean Grey, the head of the Wakandan military in Black Panther, Wonder Woman, yada yada. I want something new. Something not the norm. Black Panther had some pretty leet fight scenes especially with the Rhino mounts and a killer soundtrack. The twist with Infinity Wars also spiced shit up. Lets hope this movie is not Christian Stewart 2.0 looking constipated and talking about her new monster girl form for two and a half hours.
"Did she just punch an old lady?"
I know, I know it's a skrull... but optics and the average non comic fan won't know it. If you are gonna go at granny you might wanna set that up in the trailer.
I don't care what super powers you have if you hit my Grandma she'd whoop your arse.
1:30 when grandma sends you a birthday card but no money.
did she just punch an old grandma?
that shit alright
Gonna be honest. This trailer was sorta shit. Also you can’t say people hate the trailer because it’s a woman, I think it goes the other way, people will rate it way higher just because it’s a woman, it’s just like what happened with black panther. Black panther was a terrible film and easily the worst in the MCU, I didn’t hate it because it was a black led film, people loved it because it was a black led film. I believe that if a film of black panthers quality was a white cast then it would have gotten shit reviews
Looks like shit. I hope its gonna be good but im worried 😬😬
Imagine Ryan Reynolds as captain marvel
Lol same old cookie cutter superhero shit...sick of these films
The grandma is a Skrull
Damn she just punched that old lady like a Savage...
Why’d she punch an old lady like that
Yes the trailer wasn't very exciting but so wasn't The Winter Soldier trailer. And it's the best Marvel movie till now.
She just punched an old lady!
But why grandma?
She looks like some sort of Marvel's version of the green lantern girl. Not very original and on top of that she punches an old lady. What an original hero.
That grandma punch was noice!
*Damn there are 64k old ladies in the world* 😂😂😂
grandma is dceu
Oh shit this is real👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 finally the trailer is here
did she just punch an old lady?
I think that Grandma is DC's wonder woman in disguise
But why she hit her like that!!! 😭 Poor old wamen!
She ain’t have to slap my grandma like that😂
Everybody saw that she punched a granny right? lol
She just punched a grandma...
1:30 What did the grandma do to deserve this..
Damm it I want to see cool skrulls not that bullshit mask
i've saw some comments saying that they won't want to watch this movie because of some particular reasons like; they have no interest in watching it or whatever but how would y'all know if you didn't watch the movie yet? i'm not saying this whole thing in a mean way, just stating my opinion but it's up to y'all if you wanna watch it. even i am clueless about this whole trailer and the part where Captain Marvel punches the old lady but maybe there's something to it so that's why she punched her? i don't know i'm just assuming it because why the hell would she want to punch a damn old lady for no reason? unless that's what really happen then okay.
1:40 Batman is that u?Holly shit😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hit like if you are going to watch it
Oh captain marvel and a an old wooo OMG she punched her!!!!! But wait isn’t captain marvel a good guy and..... ooooohhhhhhh it’s a skrull!!!!
actually the old lady is a skrull......
Woah! First sorry that I've watched this now! WTF was I doing before! Really lookin forward to Female Superhero Movie that too from Marvel! Obviously it's gonna be a Damnshit Flick.
Captain Marvel: Hold My Beer...
50%:RIP granny
*proceeds to show clip of her punching an old lady in the face*
I officially hate Captain Marvel. She punched my grandma!!!
She got cross when grandma asked her. "You still wearing those jimmy hats grandma gave u?"
Really shit trailer if you don't know what this is.
So much confusion among the commenters. The old lady is just a disguise for a Skrull alien. And this takes place back in the 1990's so Fury has both eyes.
Incoming comments on how she punches the old lady.
I shall feed that grandma some butterrr chicken to make her feel better.
1st look at the KREE in their human form😍😍 when she punched the old lady😂😂
The grandma being punched is the best part
1:29, lets just punch grandma
Me : meh, who cares? It was a grenade nobody give a shit about!
thats right people our last hope is a white woman lol
She doesn't emote, she doesn't have charisma and you make her punch an old lady (albeit a disguised Skrull) nope... this already looks like trash
O shit blockbuster
Deadpool is that old lady
You know what makes the character so hot? Knowing she can beat the shit out of me with both arms tied behind her back. Whatta babe.
Shit changes.
The Only hero that has the power to beat Thanos, also has the power to punch a grandma in the face... Right?
The granny is voldemort smh
liked for slapping an old woman. that's hillarious
Not feeling it :/ need more explanation. Origin looks shitty.
The old lady is either a Skrull or a Kree, so don't worry.
Captain Marvel, the only super hero to punch a old lady. 😂
Take that grandma!!!
The Grandma Punch is gonna become a meme, I'm calling it 1:29
When the old lady at the train station thinks she had special privileges for being old this is what you do to them
Spun that grandma’s jaw
Wish they had gone with an older actress
Did she just punch an old lady...
I think the old lady is a skrull. Like if you think the same
#1:28 *What makes her a hero punching grandma .lmao*
Boring. Since wahmen can’t be hit or challenged by the villains in a movie without being labeled as sexist and misogynistic. She’s going to be a mary sue overpowered boring character. Not worth it.
The TSA guy is the villain in this movie. Sorry to spoil it for everybody. That DBZ Broly rip off attack at the end is for the poor TSA guy because he said something to her or some shit.
The best part in this trailer is when she punches an old woman in the face with no context given whatsoever
Wait why did she slap the old lady? Lmao
Too many white lead characters in movies you know white ppl arent the ONLY Americans in America right Hollywood?
In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Nick Fury said that the last time he trusted someone, he lost an eye. I bet that the person who's going to betray him is Talos because he is disguised as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D and Nick Fury trusts him before he reveals himself as a Skrull and attacks him, damaging his eye before escaping from the S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters, the Triskelion.
What idiot in the editing room decided to put the clip of her punching a (seemingly) innocent old lady in the face!?!?! Of course, comic book fans will probably assume it was a Skrull trying to disguise itself.....but to people who aren't familiar with the Skrulls....that clip is really messed up! LOL. They shouldn't have even shown it until the final movie....so EVERYONE in the audience would be surprised when it happens. They show tooooo much in trailers these days. No surprises.
The grandma was a skrull I'm guessing and Jude Law is the original captain Marvel who will mentor Ms Marvel!!  Excited.  Just want to see Avengers 4 to be honest whenever that comes out ;D
She punches an old lady in the face. Awesome!!
I tot One punch man is here :(
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old woman
1:30 when grandma didnt bring cookies
I love seeing grandmas get punched finally a movie for me
Gold fuii movies
Carol would actually be in more danger if that old lady was in fact an old lady and not a Skrull. Captain Marvel would be too busy being lectured and hit with a handbag to deal with Thanos.
1:31 when your grandma keep asking you if you're hungry
Excuse me, but I hope that this movie will be an absolute bullshit and it wont eanr money. The reason is quite simple. I hate the way they presenting this hero to the viewers. "She is strong woman with balls, she had difficult past, but now she became strong and she can beat everybody". I am right, that all this scenes with training in army and flashbacks from her past are being copied from Captain America? 
She is the first person to have the confidence to punch Grammy
Did...did she... punch an old lady??🤔🧐
Looks like Dogshit
1:31 Why would she just beat up an old lady
This is the first trailer from Marvel where I can say “I’m not impressed”. I trust Marvel tho. Waiting for the next trailer and praying this movie is a hit just like every other Marvel movie.
I hope it's just the trailers that are shit and not the movie, but the trailers are awful!
So good, makes you wanna punch yo momma!
Well holy shit I'm ready
1:30 when your grandma gives you a kiss on the lips
Am I the only one who thinks the old lady might be a Skrull?
Why captain marvel hit grandma ?
You can tell she's probably more heartless than thanos after punching an old lady
Okay, this wasnt good as they promised us but dont worry, the first trailer is shit the whole time but remembee that the second is pure fire🔥
Is this the chick everyone been talking about whos goin to save the avengers ??? She js hit an old lady lol.
What did that old lady do like what the hell 😂?!
So they are just going to dig up any old random characters and give them a movie.  Deade horse
if only that was aunt may she punched in the face.
1:31 when yo Grandma starts getting an attitude about cooking up all your favorite foods
Ughh why’s she punch an old lady
Haha great trailer! Nothing entices movie-goers like old ladies being punched.
Hit like for Marvel Studios .  😍
Bring me grandma
that granny ;-;
punching old ladies since the 90s
She deadass just punch an old lady 👵💀
Grandma: Now..now put your Fortnite away
00:07 old times , RIP BLOCKBUSTER
Maybe they chose grandma because the skrull knew that’s her weakness 💁🏼‍♂️
Hahahahaha she just punched an old lady! That guy frome the Sabrina Netflix comment was right. 😂😂😂
Punching old ladies 10/10
pretty much the lead up to her beating the shit out of thanos in the next avengers
Plot Twist: the Grandma is actually Galactus
The alt right snowflakes also said Black Panther was going to be shit as well... Then they backtracked when Milo Yiannopoulos gave it a glowing revue.
A male superhero could not get away with punching an old woman in the face. And they probably considered her punching a puppy or a child but decided against that to avoid controversy.
Finally, new boold in the franchise
1:30 when your grandma ate your last cookie.
Grandma after being punched: I don't feel so good Captain Marvel
DC: shit.
One like equals one rip for grandma
Plot twist, the skrull is captain marvel punching the grandma to get her super bad publicity in the eyes of the people
why im a triggered when that old lady gets hit.. i hope its a skrull in disguise...
only brie larson could punch an old lady in the face and get away with it
That old lady got knocked the hell out. Underwhelming trailer.
Everyone’s complaining about the movie before it hits theaters. sure her facial expressions is numb but damn give it time to redeem.
She just straight up punched an old lady IN THE FACE! Snap!
01:31 That punch across Granny's face alone would score a 5% extra fresh rating for the film! 👌🏼
She punched an illegal Alien Crossdresser
Damn dat granny 😮😮😮
This will be banned if they don't know what that old lady is.
Blockbuster!? What is this, the 90's? And why is she punching old ladies?
lol people who are talking shit about this movie aren't true marvel fans at this point, have you really learned nothing?
Watched this trailer while taking a shit
Grandma: Cookies are ready! 
please tell me that old woman was actually the villain in disguise
when an elderly person tries to hit on young, fresh meat 1:30
What she just punched an old lady
Blockbuster??? aight I’m sold
shitiest trailer of marvel i have ever seen
why would you do that to that innocent granny captain marvel
Showing it's ok to punch old woman.....ok marvel
D... Did she just punch an old lady?
and she's an oscar winner, and that may mean shit sometimes but ive seen other brie larson stuff,she's good. 
I started dying when she punched the skrull grandma
Punching an old woman. It's metaphor. Death will be won in victory. 
I'll watch it just to see brie Larson clock that old lady
Captain Marvel: Hold my beer!
Captain Marvel v Granny 
Love the punching the old lady :3
Poor old lady...
about 90% of comments are about grandma
No feminism, no bullshit, and we’re cool marvel. Don’t pull anything on us and we’re cool.
"A hero" proceeds to slap a old woman
Captain Marvel punched my grandma... WTF!?!!
Shit just scroll down
Dislike because she punched at face to the grandma
Did she just punch an old lady😂😂😂
Love marvel but what a shit trailer cmon guys
Truth be told I was ready to hang it up lol
old lady: shazam is the real captain marvel
This trailer looks like it is at least 10 years old.
am i the only one that thinks this movie will be shit, i just have a bad feeling about this one
Dang bro she showed that old lady who's boss.
What a shit. No offense
*Knockouts out Grandma*
Old lady=MGK
Had to turn the volume down at the end with all the obnoxious drum hits and fake choir, so no one in the house would know I was watching something stupid.
Ohhhh shit cant wait 😍😍
Oh 😍 😱 rip old lady 🙏
What if she didn't punch a skrull, what if a skrull punched an old lady
>>>> 1:31 <<<<<< Captain Marvel vs Smiling Grandma
What is this hippy dippy bullshit
K but she punched an old lady on a bus.
1:30 When Your Grandma Ask You Too Eat More Rice *asian problems*
Chill guys I think the old lady is her in the future look closely
Ah yes hitting seniors is my favourite passtime.
The granny punch is at 1:30
Grandma: Are you wonder woman?
After seeing this trailer I think the most exciting thing about the movie is the skrulls. I hope the next trailer plays them up more  (instead of just showing the hero punch a granny). Also some 90s music in the next trailer would be way better.
I wonder what the context is with the old lady
When Captain Marvel slapped an old lady, that just shook me so hard
So how old is she???
lol more capeshit to feed the marvel soyboys
It’s going be a great movie! But! Why she had to hit that old lady
1:30 When grandma only gives you 20$ for your birthday
I wish they showed her with the old black outfit with the yellow lighting bolt. 
Captain Marvel punched the old lady because she is a Skrull in disguise.
Sure, fans, let her smile when she punched that old lady supposedly a Skrull.
*throws a punch like a savage*
Who is here before 1mil hit like
When a old lady says Iron man will die in Avengers 4 ....
Is that thanos hiding within the old lady... !
1:31 Beware , Thanos , our new savior is a sociopath , who punches old ladies  , and she is coming for you !!!
Why’d she have to hit the Grandma though?
Don’t worry guys! The old lady is a skrull.
1:30 but why she hits old lady ??? omfg it was so funny hhhhahahahaha
Oh boy i can't wait to hear all the feminist bullshit about this movie
I don't get shit.
Really I'm not going to watch this movie because all super hero movies has gorgeous, handsome, powerful, fancy costumes nothing new just a new thing she hits an old lady in this trailer what a big deal I don't think so they just want an attraction of audience that sit I'm not an marvel hater I only love marvel comics and there cartoon series don't like there shity movies
So no one is gonna point out that this woman punched an old lady 😂😂😂
Woooow do I ever not give a shit. At all.
What if the post credit scene shows the Stark family and thanos?🤯🙌🏻 With a five years old Tony 🤭❤️❤️
1:30 When you trick or treat and the old woman gives you an apple.
Captain Marvel socking an old lady might possibly be the funniest thing I've seen all year
Has anyone ever considered the fact that Winter Soldier could be in this movie?? They could even toss in Howard and Maria Stark’s murders in the mix somehow??
Her punching an old lady hopefully means Skrulls start hiding on Earth and are already all over by the time Infinity War happens. I'd be so so so hype for a Secret Invasion MCU movie
Lmao just punch an old lady. Probably a skrull
Looks dull and boring but no doubt it will be a smash hit according to the critics because it's a female superhero movie.
1:36 that hairstyle sold me the movie, my only complain is that the actress would have made a thicker voice for the role
1 like= 1 prayer for that grandma 
Thats not an old lady its  man !  Baby yeah
Why was grandma punched?😿
1:31 socked the shit outta her oh mah gawd
did she just punch a granny
she punched granny. Nice! Good job, Marvel!
Why she need to punchee dat granny😑
1:30 when grandma gives you an attitude and thinks she's tough 😤😤
The best thing about the video was Captain Marvel punching that granny in the goddamn face ...
1:30 what the heck girl?!  that granny may or may not be a skull to prove it u don't have to punch them in the face
Oh Mann just can't wait to hit the cinemas😍😍😍😍
1:30 I am really excited when i get to see an old lady get punched on the big screens!
anyways, if y'all are hissing and bitching about Carol punching the old woman, the lady is actually a Skrull, a shapeshifting alien. basically these ugly looking clones of Mystique.
RIP every old lady on a bus in 2019. - So many copycat attacks.
Watching my grandma brush her one tooth seems more interesting.
Hooooly...Jesus...This gonna' hit!
It looks ok..nothing that makes me excited. The story seems tight but idk. That was funny with her punching the old lady on the train. Im excited about Coulson though
1:30 when you visit your grandma but she doesn't make you cookies
ONly Shittttttttttttt
Please stop using feminism or cultural appropriate to put into a TV show or movie, just choose the correct person who fit the character best, we do not want a black starfire, a black siri or old mama captain marvel;  respect all races, but should respect the original art works first.
Punching old women is such a Carol Danvers thing to do though. Remember how much joy she go in the comics doing shitty things like “punishment before the crime” in Civil War 2.
She just hit grandma?
Is this supposed to be funny? Is this supposed to be entertaining? I just don't get it. Maybe I'm getting too old, or kids just have a sense of humour I'm not getting. This just looks like a substantial waste of time, and quite frankly a bit idiotic on the part of the creator. Sorry.
This is where shits gone go downhill
Hit like if you are waiting eagerly !!!
So far, I'm not sold on the trailer.. Wake me up when it's already March 8, 19!
The Grandma punch is gonna be one hell of a meme.
Carrol Denver, coming to a grandma near you :)
That grandma skrull got her ass whooped
Why did she punch the old lady 1:30
By punching a smiling old lady to the face will make you one.
Im getting sick of this shit
Give me 2 hours of punching the elderly and I’m sold
1:30 Inspiration for a young Peter Parker to beat old ladies to get what he wants (cranberries)
Rip to that “old lady”
They spent so much time showing her as a woman doing normal stuff, that I have no idea what she actually does.  Other than telling us what's she's not, and punching old lady's.
Why are people defending Larson and her B-list acting?  There's a reason people are hating on her casting and lack of facial expression. Not only is having good facial expressions a huge part of being an actor/actress but so is having conviction in your voice so you sound like YOU are the character and not simply reading. Larson is unfortunately one of the few misses of the MCU. She sounds like a child and has the emotional range of a wet towel. And, yes, trailers are marketing for the movie, so don't try and pull that bullshit, "Oh, it's only the first trailer". Why even bother launching marketing for Captain Marvel when you're just gonna give us this lackluster excuse of a trailer? I'm a huge fan of Marvel and have been for years but this was straight up disappointing.
Beepers, Blockbuster and old cars! I am gonna love this!
Skrulls confirmed (old lady).
+ iron man (fires energy blasts from her hands and punches old people) 
This looks more like a Nick Fury and Coulson movie than a Captain Marvel movie. How is it that Samuel L. Jackson has more dialog and authoritative scenes than her? And why they would call this Captain Marvel and not "Marvel Girl" is beyond idiotic. Just like "The Force Within" used the black guy Storm Trooper scenes to start a buzz over the movie (even creating false rumors of him being a Storm Trooper-turn-Jedi from the scene and promos of him holding a lightsaber), Just as Mad Max: Fury Road was hyped around Tom Hardy playing Mel Gibson's role, Samuel L Jackson is the main force behind this movie (possibly the resurgence of SHEILD) behind this movie. But as we all know, The Force Awaken and Fury Road were nothing more than feminist finger bangers throwing a hissy fit at "representation" when they are the ones who don't want to risk ANYTHING to put ANYTHING OUT. Instead, they want a blank check like a gold digger, yet claim to be grassroots/independent.
I can imagine someone who knows nothing about Marvel but watches the MCU and sees her punching the old lady and gets really upset...I dunno I'm sure this is gonna cause a lot of backlash.
I loved the part when she punches an old woman
stop  dont do this shit
Captain Marvel: Granny, you're high on my list!
It’s a good trailer up until she punches the old lady then it’s a great trailer
I still can't decide whether I like Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, but I will withhold judgment until I see the movie. Regardless, I love the take so far, and the opening of her crashing into a Blockbuster is prime.
She had a life on earth, had an accident and somehow teleported/saved/transfered to Kree, got back to earth. Those goblin looking people are the Skrull from Avengers Secret War, a shapeshifter race, probably that old lady is a skrull.
1:30 Why punch grandma in the face? messed up
bullshit super power
People are mad dissing on the trailer but I thought it looked pretty good, and I’m sincerely hoping that the movie turns out to be really good, also people noting the “wooden” acting, but I almost think it was intentional given that in all the shots where she has that bland expression it is presumably because she is confused, not knowing what is real or what to believe. Also as for her smacking the old lady, the woman was probably a Skrull/Kree (Can’t remember which one can shapeshift and which one Captain Marvel is associated with)
1:30 when my grandma tells me to do my homework
the old lady one of the skrull
“Discover what makes her a hero” *cuts to captain marvel punching an old lady*
did anyone else see her punch an old lady
Grandma survived this.
What, you didn't realise that Carol Danvers hates old people? While it would easy to speculate that she's lost her mind and is just attacking a random civilian, common sense says that this is a Skrull in disguise. How can the hero tell? That remains to be seen but seeing these aliens disguise themselves should be a lot of fun, especially if we're not always clued in to where and who they all are here...
1:30 when your grandma said she is still virgin
pie string auto wild portion white regular lean cause prove
Who else noticed that Captain Marvel hit an old lady after the text "What Makes A Hero"
When you expected to see more 1:30 memes but find none and then get punched in the face.
Holy holy holy shit shit shit
This could be better, hoping to see another trailer of Captian Marvel better than this. Not sold on this one.
Captain marvel DESTROYS old lady...(i think thats stan's cameo though XD)
She hits the old lady because skrulls can make themselves look like humans
oh shit son we gOT JUDE LAW IN HERE
So if I punch an old lady... does that make me a superhero
She 4real decked a old lady i cant😂
I really no nothing about captain marvel but if your movie involves granny punching I'm sold
shit is about to get too realll
Granny owes her money.
Violence against vulnerable white people: check
I don't dislike this trailer as much as others do but that punching old lady after "What makes her a hero" is so misplaced.
She's like a savage punching that granny
Garbage! if they make her better than everyone else just becuse of some feminist shit they will loooose a lot of money and views btw begone thots
why captain marvel punches an old lady
A girl wearing a jumpsuit sucker punch an old lady.
That poor old lady 😭😂
1:31 *proceeds to sock Grandma in the jaw*
1 like= one less grandma punched
for those who don't know that old lady at 1:30 is actually scrull

Super awesomeeee. Bye Thanos. When she beated that old lady I laughed as heck

hahahhahahah.he punch old lady fo why?................
Whoa! Did she just punched an old lady wtf
(The Wise virgins will go with Jesus when he comes back for his bride. (Revelation 3:10-11)<---Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown). 
Only interested because I want to see why she had to punch that old lady
Everyone in the comment section is talking about the old lady being punched omegalul.
She has the same expression in every scene... then again I'm a fat white man and I hear she doesn't care what i think.
WTF you cant be punching old ladies like that if you want to be a hero! XD
She just beat up an old lady OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!
Capt. Stoneface. Her Kryptonite is smiling-because a smile is sexist-but declares who cares what white men think isn't racist. No thanks.
I always know her as “miss marvel” because of that old super hero squad show lol
LOL she smacked the soul outta that old lady! 😂
Wow I like it but way he is punch a old woman
Grandma: Dc will be better in the future
1:30 the future is now grandma
After Avengers Infinity War Comes Grandma Infinity War
Larson is an amazing actress but Samuel L Jackson and the grandma we're the only people with any charisma in this trailer. As for a teaser I don't know if it really did the job cause all they gave us was Brie Larson in Kristen Stewart mode
She sucker punched an old lady!
Imma punch your grandma
Noobs out there criticizing captain marvel for hitting the old lady. They don't even know that the old lady night be a skrull cuz skrull can fake and change their appearence.
holy shit she punched the SHIT outta grandma
"What makes her a hero" Immediately punches grandma. FUCKIN' HERO MY ASS. BAKUGO IS A BETTER HERO
*Old lady has left the chat*
Most of these comments are about how she punch that elderly lady.
AAAAAAnd Marvel continues kicking the shit out of DC...
Did she just punch my grandma?
1:31 how come you slap my grandma 😕
these people talking about captain marvel hitting an old woman don't know shit about the villain just some people following a trendy thing so they can fit in ans don't get left behind by society
I'm staying positive , I bet this will do really well money wise. But that "hitting the older lady" thing threw me. I'm sure there will be some reason for it in the movie
Sorry but this was underwhelming. Nothing about her really stands out like other superheros. This honestly feels like discount Wonder Woman. I did enjoy when she was flipping around and I loved when she hit that old lady. I hope she spends the entire movie just flipping and  punching the elderly, do that and I'll definitely consider pirating this movie one day 👍
Oh boy 2019?? Man I'd get old till then!
wtf is that shit?
Can't same I'm impressed. Looks like the same old, stale, over-cgi-ed, transformers-esque, formulaic Marvel title. "yawn." And as to Brie Larson, never heard of her until today. And she doesn't exactly inspire confidence. This looks like its gonna be another "see! girls can kick ass too!"-focused movies. I'm putting my bets on her being another unrelatable, OP'd, Mary Sue that has zero character flaws, development, or actual challenges. 
Punching an old lady.
When u came to read the comments to see how everyone feels but all u see jokes on 1:30 Grandma..
It's from old comics that's why Nick Fury has both eyes 😊....more older then Captain America
Only one Old Granny got harmed while filming this movie.
The comment section shows that how easily people can judge somebody. She punched the old lady but how do you guys are so sure that she was an old lady only and not somebody in disguise of an old lady
Today real life - Cos I'm white male and dude... I think this her o is not worth spending a penny. And actually this particular "white chick" is a big mistake and miscast of Marvel.
Other people: Oh my god! Why did she punch a sweet old lady?! 
*punches an elderly woman to epic trailer music*
Grandma deserved it
So must be working with that villian Calebcity released in one of his videos. I mean she punches grandmoms. XD
1:30 - that old lady is _probably_ a Skrull, but showing Captain Marvel punching it without context was a terrible idea.
this looks stale as shit. i thought they would have taken advantage of the 90’s setting but it just looks like a phase 1 movie with 90s cars lol.
When are we gonna get an asian women hero or that valkry girl movies!!! We are in 2018 and yet no other race has had a girl super hero and im not just talking about black people its not a black and white world. These movies are getting boring
Press F to pay respect for the grandma :(
1:30 when you arrive at your grandma's house and you find out she didn't bake you any cookies
Ow shit another great movie to watch soon😄
Lol looks like a complete piece of shit
The reason she punched that old lady (1:30) is because this movie deals with Skrull invasions most likely. Carol Danvers was a human, modified with Skrull DNA. The Skrull are an alien race at war with the Kree, that's why you see Ronin the Accuser from guardians at 1:32 . Most likely that old woman was a Skrull hiding as a human.
Why did she punch an old white lady? What if it had been an old black lady? LLLOLOLOL neverrrrr
That granny slap tho
I like how they had the blockbuster building to show that this movie will be a blockbuster hit.
Yo she just punched that grandma after it said hero
Can't wait for this Bitch to hit in cinemas!
The grandma is smiling at a chic dressed up in space body suit of sort.. maybe the grandma assumed that cpt Marvel is a good cosplayer and just smiled and commended her on her costume.. and maybe Cpt Marvel saw the grandma and remembered the Movie Legion, and was like. Naa, this granny look like she gna climb up walls, grow sharp teeth and growl at people, so leme end it now!!
Bland trailer with bland visuals and bland actor then I saw she punched an old lady? Hahah, that's the only reason I'm going to see it! I hope kids are not going to cosplay and start punching old grannies!
ohohooho holy shit boys
Holy shit, freaking blockbuster
So many good memories, Rest In Peace old friend
Lol how many punches do captain marvel will do on Thanos? Like Per Punch
Oh shit nick has an eye
That old lady just took the biggest right hook like damn
Old lady beat down
Did she just hit an old lady?!
I dont know about captain marvel, the only part from this trailer that interest me is why she punched the grandma and fury.
Amazing !!!! Guaranteed hit !!!
Punching grandma was sexist.
two words : oh shit
She punched the “loving” hell out of that grandma
i bet all those dislikes are for Grandma that got punched
ShE PuNChed ThAT ooOoOooOld LaDy 
*She beat that Grandma, like I beat my meat.*
I just shitted myself with excitement
According to half of the replies here, the old woman is a "scroll".(this is a joke,  by the way, I perfectly know what a Skrull is) 👽
1:31 Grandma stood no chance...
1:48 they tried to copy Superman.  But can't even match. This movie looks shit. 
I was sold when she punched the old lady.
**punches smiling grandma**
Hey captain , that's very rude when you punch a Old Woman . 😫
Sam Jackson in a Marvel film where he doesn’t play Nick Fury? Such horseshit...
This looks incredible...BUT.... Don't let this distract you from the fact that in 1966, Al Bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, "Spare Tire" Dixon.
*punches old lady in the face on subway*
*Captain Marvel punches an old lady
For those wondering why Captain Marvel punched an old woman it's because that woman was most likely a Skrull
Kinda funny  people freaking out over that punch
But when I saw her hitting elderly women, my opinion changed.
Sorry grandma for the  punch 👊
i love my grandma i love her pan cakes everything but i get this this tingling 1:30
Am I the only one satisfied with grandma being punched her ass out?! LOL
Did she just punch that old lady hero they mean villain
I’m not what you think I am! *she punches an old lady*
When she punched the old lady
Marvel: Let’s make a captain marvel movie. Captain Marvel: *slaps the shit out of old lady
Grandma had it coming!
Şehitle❤ 
Obviously that granny is a Skrull.
+1 For the Serious Tone without the bullshit jokes. Finally a more serious movie
Did she punch an innocent old lady? 😂
Kind of more excited for Jude Law than the heroine. Props for punching out Lo-....uh.....ooold grannie. Yup. Probably just some lady on the bus. Definitely just some old bat and nobody in disguise. Yup, nailed it.
Holy shit, almost fell asleep, if the trailer is this boring i can't imagine what the movie will be like.
1:30 How dare you hit my grandma
why she punch old lady
I really hope that grandma was just a normal grandma, cuz if she's some kind of bad guy i'd be disappointed you know what i'm saying?
Don’t mind me, just punching some old lady 👋
Punch aunt may like you do
It was just a matter of time before this trailer hits #1 on trending
I think most of us asume that the Grandma she punched was a Skrull... But i think there's something more to it then that. I think Carol get's on the train and sees the old Lady. The old Lady smiles and Carol asks if shes got any Cookied and Milk with her. The Old lady says ''No''. And that's why she punches her. I think this would send a much stronger message to people then her being a skrull. Teach the ladies when they're young that when they are old they HAVE to give us Cookies and Milk.
When the most excting part of a trailer is an old women getting punched.
Idk but the hype is not there. I don't like the way they introduce her as "emergency" plan because the avengers weren't strong enough. And the feminism and equality shit sucks(black widow and so on are dope,but not her). I stick with the real avengers!
Well Captain marvel already hit BLOCKBUSTER
Holly shit Awesome
She punched the old lady 🤔
Marvel fans hit like👍👍👍👍
bro- she punches grandmas- Calebcity warned us of this
This is Piece of shit(captain marvel) coming soon in 2019.😂..  am waiting for wonder women 2💓
She hit somebody granny 😂😂💀
This must be old?
When your grandma doesn't give you more cookies 1:31
But why did you hit granny !! 😢 not cool Captain Marvel
*punches an old lady directly afterwards*
Can you at least show a screen that the old lady transferring to a Skrull? 
Is it just me, or in the trailer she hits an old woman????
Punching a grandma is such a heroic act.
When grandma got punched my mom walked into the room that very moment and SCREAMED THIS IS WHY I DONT LET YOU WATCH YOUTUBE and threw my phone I had to explain to her that it was a alien😂
Carol Danvers is sitting in an intergalactic high school with the feet up on her desk while wearing cool sunglasses and a red and blue leather jacket while chewing gum. Sitting next to her is jock Thor and his nerdy brother Loki. Thor tries to get Carol’s number, but she just insults him for having a “small hammer”. The Kree teacher then tells Carol to be quiet, so Carol snaps her fingers and the teacher explodes. The class laughs, but Principal Supreme Intelligence isn’t happy. As a punishment, Carol gets sent back to her home planet Earth (she’s an ex-fighter pilot who was abducted because she got God-level superpowers after being bitten by cosmic radioactive spider). On Earth, two secret agents named Nick Fury and Phil Coulson catch her up on all the things she missed like 80s movies and grunge rock. Carol gets really freaked out by The Terminator and starts punching random people thinking they could be robots (that’s how Nick loses his eye, btw... and yes, of course he shouts “MUTHAFUCKA!”), but the last person she punches turns out to be a Skrull in disguise. You then see a montage of her battling Skrulls on the ground and in the air with big crazy explosions everywhere all while “Smells Like Teen Spirit”. Finally, the trailer ends with Carol suited up in her perfect, NON GREEN costume, glowing with cosmic energy in the middle of a war zone staring down a little boy. The little boy then transforms, revealing himself to actually be the Super-Skrull! That’s when Carol hears “Need some help, Captain?”, then she looks over and sees the Fantastic Four. After the “Captain Marvel” title is revealed at the end we see this scene:
I really hope they don’t make so overpowered that she can defeat thanos by her self it will the whole MCU shit
Best scenes available from 0.01 to 1.57... those who accept hit LIKE👍👍👍
Did she just punch an old woman. damn gurl
Captain Marvel punched that old lady right in the kisser because she’s a Skrull... they are kind of like all the trolls hating on this trailer, but they can shape shift.
Grandma: Excuse me where are your manne-
Damn Samuel L. Jackson can't hide his age anymore. He's looking very old now.
Oh shit is going down
Did she just slapped an old lady in a face??!! Probably a skrull
1:31 When grandma buys you a sweater for Christmas for the 7th time..
Damn that oldlady got clocked
That poor old lady...
*punches an old lady right in the jaw*
So i'm assuming the villians are the Skrull then? otherwhise it's gonna be hard to root for Super grandma puncher over here.
Her puching that old lady is going to become a meme
Copy and Paste "Captain Marvel Clocks An Old Lady" in to the search bar and you'll see one of them already
Brroooooo...she decked an old lady!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Grandma: No.
we have shazam shit, now captain feminazi returns. but everybody knew about it.
The memes which can come from this granny abuse! Let the games begin
Lol she just punched that old lady in the face
Grandma is a skrull. The Skrulls are shape shifters. There, I solved it.
The person replacing Old Cap punches Gran in the face 😂😂😂😂
Well holy shit, ats pretty good👌

Can't wait to watch the grandma scene in the movie.
get ready for captain marvel punching that old lady as a reaction gif in every political argument between younger and older generations
lmao i need context for that granny slappp
When grandma ate your leftovers 1:30
She punched an old lady in the face. This gon be gud. Also please don't jump on the hate bandwagon. Nothing in this trailer should give you reason to think this movie will suck. You don't know this Marvel character so I get your apprehension but just read up on her first. This will likely be as good as Captain America, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, etc. 😁
Bir süper kahramanımız daha oldu oley amk AS:Dsa.DasD.aSD
Would have been better if she didn’t punch that grandma
Can we please stop with all this white young woman on white grandma woman violence. It's completely out of control!
Who's here before this hits 1 Mil?
She jacked that old lady right in the face!! Probably said something bout not havin a bf... Old lady that will teach u to mind ur own business!!!
Please , punch my grandma too!
Wohw hold up, Coulson with HAIR?!!!
The old lady was probably a skrull
@1:30 well she just punch an old woman, that made me laugh.

Looks like it’s gonna be another marvel Hit!
This shit looks like Bollywood
Wondern who is dat Granny🤔🤔😂

We all know that old lady was just another member of THE HAND
why did she punch the old woman at 1:30
She punched a smiling old woman! Lmao
Her binary form is confirmed!! Holy shit, no wonder they are calling her the most powerful character in the MCU so far.
1:21 when you see a granma get punch
Another Superhit from MCU
Did Captain Marvel, the one who is suppose to defeat Thanos, just hit an old lady?
What if she just hit the lady because just felt like it
Although I love this trailer and am hyped as hell for this movie, please tell me i'm not the only one who found her punching the old lady unintentionally hilarious?
Sounds like  another shitty one
I'm no sure if this is going to be really good or really bad... this just looks really really OKAY. It might be the fact that there's a definite Marvel fatigue going on, as the series have been so mcguffin focused and they all basically have the same plot of "Bad guy wants thing or to do thing, so hero could stop the bad guy from getting the thing or doing the thing". I know that's the plot for every superhero movie ever, but when you get one and sometimes even three of these things every single year since 2008, it starts getting really old and really boring. The last good Marvel movie in my opinion was infinity war, where they actually took some risks and made kind of a good movie, but movies before that just weren't that good. Dr. Strange had little to no plot, it was the movie equivalent of showing pretty colors to a toddler. Black Panther was also just OKAY. Thor Ragnarok was just again a very OKAY movie that people really liked and forgot within a week (who can honestly say that they remember the last two Thor movies that came before?). And Age of Ultron was just sort of boring. So this trailer is showing us another potentially OKAY movie... but how long can you pump out "OKAY" until even the dumbest of your fans will stop going to the theater to see them? How long will Disney keep making movies that are just 90-120 minute long trailers for what ever is next down the drain? And the Blockbuster thing and the Nick Fury shot where he has both his eyes is the biggest "hey! it's in the past! did you get it? ha? do you get that? ha? ha? come on! did you get that?" by the studio. Yes Marvel, some of us are not completely brain dead, we understand that this is going to be a prequel to explain to people about what exactly happened in the after credit scene in the last Avengers movie. Honestly, I'm sort of done with "OKAY", I'm waiting on something as good as infinity war. Don't make another "first avenger" for Odin's sake.
She punched grandma
She is beauty, she is grace; she punched grandma in the face!
*Everyone talking about Captain Marvel punching an old lady. And i'm the only one geeking out that they had Blockbuster of all things in the trailer..*
Plot Twist: The old lady wasnt a skrull.
Herkes kahraman oldu awk dünyada normal insan kalmadı qwqweqw
What kind of shit is that... lol
Another super hero pile of shit made by Marvel for kids, stop paying for this you little turds
I’m seeing a lot of hate towards. I don’t wanna hear shit about the people who said it’s bad when the same don’t go see the movie.🤷🏽‍♂️
Can't wait to find out about how bad of a white male I am.
Whelp that was a shit trailer. Hopefully the next one is better like the other films.
Young Fury, youn Coulson, Carol punches an old lady and wears the cowl. Well I'm sold.
You know you're getting old when movies start origins in the 90s.
What the piece of shit I've been watched now??
"Discover what makes a hero". Punches grandma
Whos ready to see the old lady get punched!
Why did she crack a grandma tho
I love the scene where she punches the old lady.
Damn, did she just punched an old lady?
Punches old lady in the face.
hit the  like marvel
only reason punch old lady lol
(For those of you who don't know, the rival of Carol Danvers--the former Ms. Marvel--is Mystique, a mutant featured in the X-Men comics and movies. Their rivalry peaked when Mystique forced her daughter, Rogue, who can absorb superhuman abilities through touch, to grab hold of Carol, draining her powers and putting her in a coma. Would have been an EXCELLENT way to explain her being gone for all these years.)
1:31 God damn, she hit her with that detroit smash
the binary form of her at the end was like shit...
In real life of Marvel(comics); Rogue joined the brotherhood, almost kills Captain Marvel-hence her long lasting abilities to fly and massive strength-putting Ms Marvel into a comma. Joins the X-Men and then finds out Mystique is her adopted mother. I better see some more of my faves, Rogue and her love interest (Gambit) now they are introducing Captain Marvel. Rogue does hold significance to Captain Marvel's life; in all the Avenger comics, they are foes to one another.
Dark as CA Winter Soldier.
1:30 poor old lady, I can't stop laughing (maybe a skrull?)
i bet thanos wouldn't punch an old lady.
Try that shit on Jean Grey
Poor old woman
Grandma getting punched is something I'm very curious about..
Old Lady: I love the young people :)
Punch that grandma for taking your seat girl!
I would be more excited but the promotion keeps making her a “female” hero. Why can’t they just make her a hero. Like in a magazine they said the future is female or some shit. I love the character, but she’s a cool hero, not female hero.
Old lady: HI WONDER WOMAN
I think that grandma take her seat thats why she got punched.
Gentelman and ladies please dont say that scene with the grandama was funny because maybe that grandma is a skrull !! wait and watch the movie!!
Grandma: Hi! 
Another box office hit for marvel😘😘
Why they do grandma like that
Why did she punch a old lady
Wow it's alot like a green lantern type superhero. Still could not give a shit
Holy shit holy shit holy shit holy shit

Ohhh shit !!!!!!
when you know it was YOUR grandma Lil Pump was talking about
I’m taking a shit while watching this
Looks like shit!
1:30 When youre already full but grandma wants you to eat again
1:30 When you stand up to adjust your pants but some old lady thinks you offered your seat.
*Proceeds to punch old lady in face five seconds later*
Awesome trailer looks like some serious shit!!
Now you guys might wondering why did captain marvel punch a fricking old lady,maybe it's because she might think that the old lady is a skrull since we all know that in the comics the skrull can shape shift into anyone,or maybe she was mind f***ed by the skrull and make her evil for a couple of minutes,but HEY THATS JUST A THEORY,a MARVEL THEORY............................................................................................................................you know what,just watch the movie when it hits theater,I am not the director of the movie,just like I said that is just a theory,a MAR-ok now that's just getting old ON MY WAY TO BANG MY GF BYEEEEEEEEE
anyone from nepal,hit like

Holy shit, Blockbuster!
marvel - can never hit a note wrong . fantastic .
That old lady is Thanos in camouflage (or using Reality stone)
This fan made trailer look like shit..
She slapped a old woman 
Dam so in this trailer it just told us samuel j is alive so that fuks up infinity war 2 for whos coming back
Best part was when she hit that old lady
That old lady. Legion all over again.
Another feckless blonde with limited talents for pre-pubescent boys to drool over and pre-teen girls to strive to emulate by dieting, bleaching their hair, and punching out Marilyn Brett in the trailer?
I felt that punch
Yo her outfit is sick. Also that punch on the old lady.
Would have been the perfect Betty White cameo.Y'all know which moment I'm referring to.
She punched the fuxk out that old lady. This movie is gonna clap
The Skrulls are among us..  And it's time to punch them in the face!
True heroes are always granny beaters
I hope that old woman did not wear her false teeth that day 😫😫
Why she hit that old lady with no context before the trailer ended
*punches Granny into the next marvel film*
"Discover what makes her a hero" cuts to a shot of her punching out an old lady. Wow! Heroic! ROTFLMFAO!!!!!
don't make fun of her punching that old lady.. at least she went for the head lol
Imagine if that old woman wasn't actually a skrull...
Boring AF. Can you possibly be more generic? Who even gives a shit about "captain marvel"?
I can’t help but laugh at the fact that she just beans this old lady in the face
This looks like some DC shit
Looks shite to me, only gonna watch for coulson
Female superhero. Looks like shit.
So we gonna ignore her punching an old lady in the face 😂😂
holy crap she punched an old lady in the face
Why tf she smack an old lady
Think of a funny reason why she would punch her besides being a skrull.
Am I wrong or was the most exciting thing in this trailer her smacking the grandma??
She just punched an old lady in the face
Damn I feel bad for the old lady
Is no one talking about how she just smacked a granny
1:30 whenever somebody talks shit and you don't care who they are
1:30 when the cookie box in your grandma house is just a bunch of sewing needles and threads
You r copying supergirl, superman u shiters, dont create a girl like superman, u will never create a hero like DC Superman.
Samuel L. jackson at his PRIME...sold... Looks fresh of the Pulp Fiction set....kudos to the digital effects dept. ...There's so much 90's early 2000's  footage of him it would be hard to goof that up... Clark Gregg is just HOT, they nailed his look too... lol
Wow, I missed the old lady taking a super-powered fist to the face when I watched this the first time
Honestly, pretty ... boring. I know would go absolutely bonkers but if they can't take the heat why the bloody hell are they in the kitchen in the first place. Not to say you're uneducated, which you all will probably say about me, but it's true cold and hard as it may be. It's just how it is.
Old people vote trump
1 like = 1 new pair of dentures for grandma
she punched an old lady in the face on a PUBLIC bus so does that mean that everyone saw her punch a grandma 1:31
Hmmm! Reminds me of a 2011 superhero movie with Ryan Reynolds. 
Now that the MCU have access to the X Men characters, please keep Rogue as far away from Captain Marvel (a.k.a Ms Marvel) as possible!...😂😂😂 old school fans know what I'm talking about.
Never mind that shit! Who else is hyped for the next Avengers? I can't wait to see what happened after the Snappening!
Y she smacked a grandma
Ahh, the good old days of Blockbuster video
Lamfo it just hit one million like on video
She knocked that old lady's lights out...LOL
😍her.. but old lady 😆
who's here before it hits a million hahah!
dosent look interesting at all i disliked this none sense shit
Bullshit  Bullshit 
1:31 is that being a hero? Hitting an elder? I feel sad for the old woman...
Completely representive of what our culture wants, down with males, turn them into to politically correct and trendy females punching hero's. All for money.
I laughed when she punched that old lady.
You know what really makes a hero? Punching old ladies in the face. That's your only requirement.
1:31 Did she just punch an old woman in the face?!
Holy shitt!!!!!!!
Did she just hit an old lady
1:32 Did she just smack that old lady in her filthy Skrull face?!
1.5k Ronan Fans or They Are Another Universe Shits🤣🤣🤣🤣
OMG grandma! 
For those wondering, that old lady was a Skrull. Skrulls can shapeshift
Shit, I wasted 2 minutes 😧
Şehitler ölmez va❤ 
Females stepping into more traditionally masculine roles. But instead of celebrating femininity and all of the strength that it holds, they take on masculine traits. This is bad for both men and women. This should be offensive to females because they’re insinuating that the strong and positive traits that are intrinsic to femininity aren’t sufficient any more, and offensive to men because not only are women stepping into Male roles but they are also painting men in negative and incompetent light. •the sniper in Wonder Woman. •Homer Simpson. •Peter from Family Guy. •The father from Incredibles 2. This has been happening for years. It’s time for Men to stand up and retake masculinity whilst at the same time celebrating femininity. The TWO genders need to work together as we have done for hundreds of thousands of years to overcome adversity.
Here before this shit blows up!!
proceeds to smack an innocent old lady
You punch that old bag😂😂😂
To all those wondering why did the old lady got punched because she is a skrull
Rip old lady 2019-2019
Breaking News : "Captain Marvel just hit an old lady....that girl got some issues"
wtf? She punched an old lady?? o_O
I think the reason why captain marvel punches that older lady is because the old lady is a skrull bc skrulls can shape shift.
No one gonna talk about how she just slapped a granny
If it weren't for Bree Larson being an utter shit stain of a human being I'd go see this in theaters. First Marvel Studios film I'll be actively skipping out on.
1:30 Dislikes From Grandma😂
looks very shitty tbh
Lets punch it
“A grandma with a black eye...”
Tonight, Captain Marvel punches an old lady!
I remember her on twitter sobbing about a dude who asked her phone number. How hard is the life of a VIP woman in the most rich country of the galaxy, oh if you only knew. We're not supposed to support these kind of shitty persons.
1:30 When The Old Lady On The Bus Tells You To Turn Your Music Down.
A Movie For Women For Their Inspiration Let's Inspire Women They Need It Such Bullshit Man Feminism Really Did It's Job And Now We See It Even In Game's And Movie's Oh Yeah We See It Clearly Who Have Played Spiderman Game You Know What I'm Talking About Bro
Did she just punch a grandma!
The best part of this trailer is when she punches that old lady in the face!
Joo she punshed my grandma !
Granny get punched in the face is gonna be a meme. 😂
A huge MEH but I'm still gonna the shit out of it.
A terror to behold
Thanos:oh shit
"Im not what you think I am" No shit your going super saiyan 1:46
If ur reading comments  ...follow me on insta @the_mohit.k
Old ladys are the real THREAT
Skrull thought she wouldn't hit an old lady 😂 and we get to see furys  eye ripped out? Looks like a good movie
I just don't really see Larson as being the character superhero, she just looks like a mundane actress wearing costumes. The scenes of her with the others on the green uniforms makes me think of Green Lantern.  lol  (I know the original Kree uniform in the comics was green and white, but in the movie they even make that green and greenish-dark grey)
Şehitler ölmez vatan bölün❤
She found a kree in the train who look like an old woman.
I understand that, in trailers, you want to give the audience glimpses of the greatest parts of the movie in order to entice them into watching said movie. I'm also sure that Cpt. Marvel punching an old lady in the face will result in that old lady actually being some sort of powerful antagonistic entity and that moment will be a great one in the film. I also understand that you don't want to give too much away in the trailer, so the glimpses we get are indeed just glimpses. Having said all that, showing our protagonist smile smugly, then punching an elderly person in the face without context, intermixed with clips of her doing awesome stuff set to awesome music, all concluded with title cards reading "find out what makes a hero", is by far the silliest thing I've ever seen in a Marvel movie trailer. The silliest. By far. Just wanted to bring that to your attention, and good luck with the subsequent memes.
The reason why she punched the old lady because skrulls can shapeshift just a fact
the old lady is probably a skrull ..
-Nick Fury (CW:Winter Soldier)
1:30 Yoooo! She out here punching grandma’s! CalebCity, where are you?
I could not stop replaying her punching that grandma. Its about damn time
definitely not gonna hit as WONDER WOMAN movie
Granny got slumped
she deadass punched a grandma
That old lady must have abused her as a child.
Captain Marvel : Hold my beer....
she punched the shit out of that old lady
Captain Marvel’s dream was to become a pilot and then when she grew older, Nick Fury introduced her to be a pilot to defend the skrull invasion. Unfortunately the team didn’t made it and Captain Marvel got cosmic power and got shot by the skrull and fell down to earth which shown in the trailer. After that, she and maybe with Colson prepared to defend the skrull invasion on earth.
Er........meh......sure, whatever. But sheesh can we talk about her punching that old woman? Bit of a tonal inconsistancy there
I find it funnier if you forget about the skrull just imagine that was actually an old lady and that old lady just slaps her with more power
Marvel:hold my 🍺
..she just punched the granny in her face...
When grandma tells you don't forgot the broccoli but you're full. 1:30
You're just a bunch of Feminazis, that only wants female never get hit by anyone and yet want men to be hit in the face???. Misandristic Bullshiting!!!
damn rip old lady 1:30 💀
"mommy, why did she punch that old lady in the face?"

_Captain Marvel locked behind bars_ *"That grandma was the enemy I tell you! THE ENEMY!!!"*
I'm not offended by her punching that oldie cause a wamen can do it to a wamen💠

I'm sorry for the old lady
1:30 She punched Peggy
BOY: You told me to do it without using tables.
Beating old granny in public
Everybody was talking all the shit about venom when they showed a teaser now that it comes out next month its gonna be sold out just wait till this comes out everybody gon wanna see it
That poor old lady lol what if she wasn’t an enemy in disguise
Well damn, looks like Feige might have another hit in his hands..... Super Saiyan Brie looks amazing.
Everytime I see a granny i Think of the granny in Legion....
Grandma was obviously a Russian troll
When captain marvel punches that old lady it got me dying in the floor
the old lady was a kree just do your research
Hey guys what was that building she fell into at the beginning? I remember reading about it once. It’s an old legend;  it was some structure built by the ancients long since abandoned or something like that.
This shit better be different than the last few films...
The old lady is actually just an old lady the reason captain marvel hits her is cause she didnt offer her seat i mean captain marvel was in the army such disrespect to the American army cannot be overlooked old lady or a child they gonna get a punch.
Everyones saying the old lady is a Skrull. I really kinda hope shes just a normal old lady and its a really awkward mix up.
I was watching this video when my friend sent this link and it lead me to the same video so I told him and he told me to shut up and to thank him and that none of that happened
I knew about Captain marvel punching the old lady, and I laughed so hard at it.
43 k dislikes because she punched a grandma JAJAJAJA, do not forget that skrulls can take any human form, even granma`s form
Who else doesn’t give a shit about captain marvel?
*punches old lady in the face*
Did Earth's hero just punch and old granny in the face!?
Oh shit!!!!!!!!!!
The grandma she punched might have been a shapeshifting skrull, so dont worry guys :)!
Yo? This shit is lit af! I love Brie Larson since 21 jumpstreet. 😁
Old lady is dead no further questions until she is bought by Fox for an X-Men movie
So is everyone just going to ignore that she punched an old lady in the face?
1:30 Captain Marvel:"Yo granny. Hope you took your Geritol. Cuz it's time to dance!"
Wonder woman aint got shit on her
This trailer looks stunningly average. Nothing unique except the old lady getting punched. Hopefully the movie will be more promising than the trailer.
Lol what if the old lady isn't a skrull
PC correct bullshit
Another boring white women trying to save the world. Count me out
1:31 When you were eyeing that last seat on the bus, but the snarky old woman takes it and just smiles at you.
Old lady getting punched is going to become a meme
This is the most generic superhero shit i've ever seen. It is gonna be good. just good.
I bet when Captain Marvel punch the old lady will be a lady who agrees? I guess I will get no likes but everyboby else does
Skrull granny takes it on the chin.
Did she just punch an old lady or was it a skrull
Wow, shows how Feminism hates old white people and the patriarchy...
So she punched a elderly lady, so ethier the elderly lady is a skrull or it was a misunderstanding.
WOW... no comedy scenes, just straight up action. I think the only comedic part was when Captain marvel punched a grandma, but other then that really good trailer and i think this movie will end up being really good.
Oh shit, she punched the old lady
She punched a granny man😂😂😂
When she punched the grandma i was like wait WHAT 🏃🏾‍♂️🤣😂😭
Old Lady: women's are not equal to the man's, new feminism is a garbage!
Who else thought that the grandma partwas too much😂😂
Did she just hit the old woman?😂😂😂😂
Imagine her punching that old lady 'cause she thinks she's a skrull, but she will turn out as a human, and *captain marvel just fuckin' punched an old lady in the face* lol
The old lady is probably a skrull
I'll check it out when it hits netfix on a slow day.
Just if you are wondering 1:30 is where Captian Marvel punches the old lady.
Everyone else is talking about the grandma getting punched and I'm here thinking how she feel through a blockbuster when they don't exist anymore
My vote is that the old lady is a Skrull, which will be the catalyst for the entire reboot of the MCU with many of the current contracts about to expire.
My yt channel's edgy af watch dat shit
Blockbuster and abused grandma, hell yeah
*Pew die pie, make a meme review of the grandma getting punched please*
this seems shit
Please comic book nerds... oh please tell us ALL again how the old lady is most likely a Skrull! dazzle us with your brilliance.
Maybe the old lady is actually a skrull so that's why captain Marvel punched her
She hit that old lady so hard she won't be in the movie when it come out.
Captain Marvel: *cracks grandma*
Why did she punched the old lady
“....makes her a hero” *punches an old lady*
Beat an old lady? That’s not right.
damn what that granny do
...Someone who hits old ladies and doesn't afraid of anything?
Just cause you’re a girl doesn’t mean its ok to punch an old woman. Also, flat butt
...said trailer hits 1 million likes, second only to Infinity War... ouch! XD
Hold My Beer
Yo sooo she just slumped a grandma
Everybody asks why she punched that old lady in the face? I theorize that is a Skrull.
"Am not what you think i am + Hitting Grandma ?
That poor old lady I mean she could be a bad guy in disguise but still that hurts to watch
This whole trailer is a meme lol 1:31 is the old lady being punched into an explosion and at 1:16 it’s trolls part two
Did she punch that granny?
That shit was nanners cuz
1:31 when your grandma doesn’t give you her wifi password
I'm not sure I could ever like her after she punched an old grandma. That was some college kids main food source.
Holyshit holyshit. The mask!
he punch grandmom
The moment she punches that old lady though, that was pretty lit lol
Guys do not judge this trailer. Venom teaser trailer got a hell lot of dislikes. Then trailer hits, everyone can't wait to watch the movie.
Her punch is weak compared to wonder woman
LOL the grandma scene . I can't wait for this
All you gave to do is put hair on sams face and its a new character, young or old
Gal Gadot fans hit like🖒
Oh my god she hits a grandma! Evil~
**captain marvel punches an old lady in the face** 10/10
1:30 when u go to Grandma's house and u don't get shit from her....
* Punches old lady *
Why hit the grandma in the face?
"For the hero's journey to work, you have to initially deny the heroic call" has been true since the times of old luke (and literature ofc)
Oh you know this old if it got BLOCKBUSTER!!!
Looks like shit tbh
Jesus I feel like I have seen this shit already. Marvel needs to change things up....
Bruh she hits a granny
That grandma was thanoses older sister .No wonder why she hit her
Captain Marvel: I was beating up grandma's.
Did she just sock an old lady??
What an odd casting choice, must of hit the casting couch hella hard... Margot Robbie or Roonie Mara would of been far better picks for this role.
She hit the kind old lady
When grandma presses the off button on your consul thinking it’s the volume
Wouldn't it be funny if the old lady was just an old lady?
Okay, Marvel Studios. This sucks. Real talk. People are saying "boring" and only talking about the granny scene. Not very good buzz. But it's early yet. You can still fix this movie!
1:31 The old lady didn't want to give up that seat. RIP old lady.
1:40 Hold up... 🤔
kek, mfw blockbuster and the granny are the highlights of this trailer, rather than Captain Marvel herself.
A child someday will copy her and punch an old lady because that's what made her "a hero"
Did this girl punch an old lady 1:30
Proceeds to punch elderly woman in the face
I wasn't all that excited, feeling that marvel overload, but holy shit, this trailer, has restored some of my fervor!
*Punches old lady in the face*
I gotta watch it just to see why she smacked the old lady
@1:31 Granny: Why hello!!!! What a lovely lovely day isn't deary!?! Say your not from around here are you puddin!?! Back in my day everyone was always so happy!!!! Why do you look so sad my child!?! Let's put that frown upside down! Oh the trees outside look soo beautiful today! Don't you agree deary!?! Why do you look so serious? Lets put a smile on that face! Lady Marvel: I'm sick and tired of these god damn motha fking grannys on this god damn motha fking bus! Kapow!! Punch! Pow! Slap! 😂😃😄😎
I wasn’t interested until I saw her punch a grandma it’s probably a skrull but the visual has interested me
it sounds like barbie's voice, not a hero what's going to hit thanos
*1:30** Captain Marvel wanted to meet Stanlee not just any old person😂😂😂😂😂*
Old woman: You can't get my seat. Don't you see I am an old woman?
Literally already a blockbuster hit
proceeds to punch a old woman in the face
Şehitler ölmez vatan b❤ 
Punch old people in the face
did she just punch that old women
This superhero shit is getting old. Its kinda the same film every single time. Only the abilities change.
That old lady punch was weak asf
Captain feminism just punched an old lady hahahaha funny meymey 
Grandma Getting
strongest Avenger shit
1:31 When your grandma doesn’t make your favorite meal.
to be honest this trailer is shit
Imagine if that old lady she punches is just a normal old lady and everyone else on the train is like wtf did you just do to aunt Edna???
Imagine grandma is not a Skrull. 😂
Shit trailer hopefully movie is good
1:30 when your granny forget the kiss
Thanos would be shitting rn....
Disney and their rubbish social engineering propaganda sold as good entertainment.
1. Absolutely NO social justice or feminism stuff in it. At all. People are sick of being told women are weak, men are terrible, and that they need to bring men down to bring women up. Even most _women_ hate modern feminism (81%). It is a cancer and social justice IS GUARANTEED TO KILL YOUR MOVIE. Just look at Marvel _Comics_ if you don't believe me. Or Star Wars. Alienating 99% of your audience for that "woke" market is just stupid business that only stupid people would condone. *NO POLITICS!*
Wtf did she just punch an old lady for no reason whats so ever lol
It look like shit Just saying. Not because I hate women's okay.
Basic White Woman the movie lol
Punching old lady??? Thats not what hero do.
EXCITEMENT!!!!!! THINGS HAPPENING!!!!! LOUD NOISES!!!!! c'mon i didnt catch shit from this trailer and neither did you, edgy prepubescent.
Old lady puncher
Because beating old ladies who may or may not be Skrulls is just the thing to put her over Wonder Woman...that and they gave her that stupid helmet to boot.
I kinda hate that shes a new character, coming to the mcu. But is the strongest from the start. While we have seen all these other characters grow up and become a hero. And shes just the strongest y'know. I dont care that shes Carol Danvers is a woman but with all the political shit going on it makes me look at her diffrently.
Punch that old lady
Old lady on the bus was Permit Patty.
I know they're trying to get attention your movie Marvel, but did you really have to do granny like that? 😢
Grandma: Want my baseball bat? Captain Marvel: Want my FIST!? *punch*.  I’m pumped for this film!!!
1:31 did she just slap an old lady!?! And how old is Samuel L. Jackson in this? He looks like how he looked in Pulp Fiction.
the grandma is a skrull, that's why she got whacked.
1:30 When your grandma wants you to eat but you're not hungry
Marvel Fans: This trailer was pretty shit, i'm probably not going to watch it.
She better not actually be the most powerful avenger, it'd be so boring for a character no one actually has any investment in to play a bigger roll in part 2 than thor or iron man or some shit
Am not intrigued by this .. And I love marvel and their shit
Can't wait after Cap. Marvel b-slapped that skrull granny...Here we go!
1:31-When you grandma not receive pension anymore
This looks like the cheapest worst movie from the mcu yet. No it doesn't matter that she's a women, I liked Wonder Woman so don't even start with me on some sexist shit this just looks bad.
Out stumbles Marie (Rogue) who is clutching her head as Captain Marvels powers and memories overwhelm her, we see the blue skin of a white gloved hand that is Mystique reach out to "Help" Rogue only to see her get slammed into the far alley wall by Rogues new super strength.
Fk marvel i dont even give a shit no more
I know the old lady is a Skrull....but gosh was that necessary to show 😐😐 because there are lots of people here who don't know that. They should have shown the old lady firing or fighting crazy then it would justify the punch.
Legend says captain marvel hits grandma million times and counting🤤
Carol going full Hot Fuzz here on that granny. Always great to see the elderly getting what they deserve. 
Plot twist: The old lady is actually Stan Lee
Did you see how see slugged that old lady in the face? Lol
Oh shit forgot to switch account
@1:31 what if she was just a normal grandma not a shapeshifter. LMAO.
I can't wait for the part where she slaps the old woman!
I think that old lady is a skrull...
When your grandma thinks that iron Man is Superman 1:30
Bitch hit grandma for ?lol
I damn near died when she punched the granny.
Rip the old lady
Grandma gets punched: 1:30
This shit doesn’t even look super appealing. It looks like a fan made trailer. I think marvel peaked. I also don’t like how they’re making her the strongest
"I'm not who you think I am!" - Mark Wahlberg after punching an old lady! ;^)
Why punch old woman?
Dang She just sucker punched that old lady
They try to tell you it’s in the past just by showing that good old blockbuster
Yo im on my grandma account rn trying to find out who grandma she just power slapped 😭😂 how she strong arming old ladies
I was waiting for the part where she trashes white people but I guess I gotta wait for the full movie for that.
proceeds to punch an old woman in the face
All the bad comments, y'all get serious, they are introducing a new side or Marvel. Plus you're going to go see it anyways... So people saying it feels like DC/Green Lantern shit, is stupid because DC isn't the only publishers with Cosmic beings... I'm pretty sure Silver Surfer will be on his way soon 😍😍😍 Also it's the first trailer they aren't going to give all the juice away when the movie doesn't even drop till next year. ,😔😔😔 Relax with the hate. It's gonna be a good movie.
Marvel are out of stories to make this silly movie???  I miss the old day's movies
shit looks wack .
Captain marvel hit a old woman
Shit looks boring.
Phil Coulson and Nick Fury look so fine here! But, yeah Captain Marvel is a badass, she just hit a grandma to the face. Fast forward to 2019 please.
So old lady = Thanos?
Pimp slapped that grandma...
*grandma smiles*
Wait why did she punch an old lady
If Marvel touches me i would be gold becouse everithing they touch becomes gold!!!
Love the granny punch 🥊
did smacking the old lady break the internet yet?
Why did she sock an old lady?
So captain marvel must be older or same age with tony then
wow Brie, the internet sure is broken now, from how shitty this looks.
She punched old aunt may😂
Holy shit 😱😱😱😱😱 this is brilliant
Old lady is clearly a skrull. They even have a skrull in its own form in the trailer. However, if she's not  then that's even better, 😂😉😂
R.I.P. Old Lady..
She hits an old lady. Boycott this movie. It’s ok to hit women?????
Punched the shit outta that old lady lmao
Hey marvel I just wanted to say that I am 13 years old and if you do put miles Marelis in Spider-Man I want to play the Roll I know gymnastics so just letting you know
When she punched that old lady i was deadass about to die
If you guys are destroying old discontinued stores destroy Toys R Us next!!
Punching an old lady in the face on the Bus just makes me want to watch the movie more than twice
I think she punched that old lady because it was a skrull...damn I hate them
But what if that old lady is captain marvel as her older self?
Old woman: *smiles
Why punch in old lady
Damnit Marvel, why the hell did you have to add that shot IN THE TRAILER? Knocking out an old lady?? Don’t you know the social climate of our time? Goddamnit! This is all everyone will be talking about. 😂😓
The trailer is truly missing something it just doesn't hit home
I'll save you the time. All the comments are about Goodbye Grandma, Blockbuster and Award Winning Twilight Expressions.
Didnt like the trailer. Seems to be a movie that might not do the job after how big infinity war was. I mean ant man 2 was hilarious and entertaining.  Also the trailer doesnt explain much. And I mean im sure there is a reason she punched old lady in the face, but what a stupid thing to put into a trailer.
Behold, the character who will come in out of nowhere and beat Thanos.
I also hate when old people steal my bus seat
She just punched that old lady in the face. What a savage
Poor grandma....
Oh shit! I can't wait
Imagin that Old grandma was Loki
*beats an old lady*
Is that granny from legion
Captain Marvel hits an old lady, 
70%- granny  
Cleaning up the streets from nice smiling old ladies, that's what makes her a hero
1:30 When your grandma gives you only 5$ to go out with your friends and you need 20
Yoooo but she punched an old lady
Did she punch that old lady
What the Shit I'm late😤😤😤😤
Welcome to watch.Beat up grandma
So captain marvel goes into subway or train station thing and punches an old person while shazam (also  captain marvel ) gets his powers from an old person
Never let it be said that you can't save the world unless you punch a few little old ladies.
Shit trailer, isnt she supposed to be the strongest marvel character? I reaaally hope they wont bother with some boring origin story for 3/4 of the movie before they show us what she can do...
This is Jacob he is 0 years old
Am i the only one who statisfied when cpt marvel hit that old lady?? No? Okaaay.. I need Jesus
Enough with this super hero shit
1:30 Why？Maybe this granny is skrull?
So the strongest being in the universe will be killed by a blonde who decks old ladies? switching to DC. PCE
Punching grandma!!!!! 
After ```Avengers infinity war``` Block buster hit👌👌👌 
This shit connects to avengers 4,that's the only reason I'm gonna go watch this.btw I don't care about captain Marvel or brie Larson.
captain marvel's gonna be as old as that lady by the time Thanos snaps his fingers lol
The grandma was a skrull. She gives like a nervous smile because she knows she’s been caught. That’s why Captain Marvel pinched her
Skrulls!!!! Old lady gets punched in the face  (skrull) of course!  Fury before the eye patch! Agent Collison in another movie 😀👏👏👏 because it's in the past! Kree!!!  Blockbuster store😀👏👏👏, the good time memories! I wonder if they will have super skrull in this🤔🤔? That would be epic!!!! First Eminem kills mgk ! Now this trailer!  What an awsome couple of days!
I'm going to punch an old women after watching this trailer.
Well that old lady is dead
can I get an f in the chat for that poor old woman
Brie Larson kind of just looks bored the whole trailer, except for that moment when she punches an octogenarian, she seemed into that
I don't know why Captain Marvel punch the old lady but I'm excited.
When she punched that old lady  I was tripping no cap😂😂😂
1.4 billion box office hit
Uuuuuu that poor old lady😂😂
Old lady:whats an "mcu"?
Captain Marvel punching an old lady in the face - 11/10
1:46 look out Thanos shits about to hit the fan for you
I'm sold. I just think this was more of a teaser than a trailer.
Maybe A skrull disguised as captain marvel and hit the lady
Wait, hold on.
Beating old ladies?
Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up... and punch an old lady in the face.
" I'm not what you think I am " ...  1:30 smash the granny
Where is voldermord?
OK here we go! No more DC fan boy Bullshit! Marvel has gotcha again! Guess I won't have to wait for Infinity wars 2 to see a good movie!
1:30 Did... Did she just punch that Granny?
Carol has seen Legion that granny ain't fooling her
They had me at "Blockbuster".... then the image of her punching the old lady  (who I assume is a Skrull) just sent it over the top.
So she punches Roseanne!!!
"Soldiers trust each other that's what makes it an army. Not a bunch of guys running around shooting guns."
*why did i have no reaction to the elderly woman getting punched but i quaked & gasped when phil showed up*
When she punched that old lady damn that the dream to anyone who annoys me
What'll you do if a creepy old lady looks at you slowly while smiling creepily?
Ok hold up, all of these people dogging the whole movie because of the trailer, what is your problem? You damn well know Marvel keeps things under pretty tight lips (unless Tom Holland knows about it), so they never spoil anything in the trailers. This movie is going to be amazing and a key component into Avengers 4. So shut your mouth and get ready to see it in March.
Whats the chances that old lady voted for trump?
one punch from caped baldy saitama and she's finished
Me: *sees grandma scene*
She's on record saying she doesn't care if white men see her films, so I won't.
Hit like who saw this trailer before crossing 1M views
Now  if you are white you can't criticize ANYTHING about this move according to Carol Danvers
I don’t know how I feel about this movie after she punched that obvious skrull disguised as an old woman, I don’t think I want my future kids to be punching oldies because of this movie
I thought she was going to punch stan lee while sitting in the train
1:31 she just slaps up and old woman wth lol
Looks good! A sure hit movie. She punched grandma lol. Can't wait for Avengers 4!
Rip grandma holy shit
The old lady smack moment is already ICONIC. The comments on Reddit are hilarious.
Deadpool's luck lady should defeat THANOS..hit like
Guessing the old lady is *not* a Skrull..
looks kinda lame and too white
If anyone is wandering why she hit that old lady, it was probably a skrull
I'm kind of glad the trailer is shit in all honesty. I've always thought movie trailers give too much away.
*Insert granny joke here*
Did she just punch an Old lady?!?!
Well, it looks like shit
Viewers that old lady is a skrull😂😂
*That old lady must have told her to smile more*
1:30 when grandma don’t make u fat
I love how so many people are saying that this looks so boring and shitty. Its 2 minutes of footage and your gonna judge a whole movie off it?
WFT! Did she punch a grandma???!!! 👵 👊
Old woman is the skrull?
Grandma is a skrull!
WOW... I'm feeling like a 5 years old boy again 😋
Forget young Fury and Coulson. The best thing in this trailer is Captain Marvel punching an old lady in the face.
I'm pumped for this shit, but i have one hang up. If this takes place in the 90's, how in the hell is brie larson supposed to not age? It would have been like 20+ years. I don't know shit about Captain Marvel tho so I'm guessing I'm missing the part where she doesn't age.
Woah wtf she hit the granny
I feel like my grandma would be the type to slap/punch her back
Shittiest trailer released by marvel ever
To become a hero i must punch and elder......noice
Shit looks so bland
I'm hoping the grandma was a skrul because what other reason would there be...but the trailer looks dull and I think marvel taking a risk by making a movie of a character not many now but I'll watch it...online
She is my Grandma
We'll have to wait & see to understand why Captain Marvel punched that granny 🤔
Prepare for Marvel Studios woke version of Ryan Reynolds' Green Lantern. This. Will. Suck.
the old lady was a scroll alien
What makes her a hero punches old lady
Typical girl power shit.
Yooo, wtf, she punched an old lady.
Did I spot some Skrulls & an older  Male version of Captain Mar-Vell there?
Wait wait wait 1:32 IS THAT RONAN FROM GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY? oh god we bouta be hit with a bangger
1:30 when grandma doesnt cook you homemade cookies
Grandma got a good beating in this movie damn
Gotta love white people. Always depicted  as hero's.
So we're gonna ignore the fact that she just punched an old lady in the face?
She punched an old woman 😦
When she punched that old lady I lost it
Damn why tf she whack that old lady for?
I will not be seeing this filth social warrior bullshit. I want BILLY the little kid.
1:31 she ain't have to do that old lady like that 😂
Good Trailer All the best From India Hit like
The old lady is deadpool making a cameo appearance disguised as an old lady..
-All the old lady able to use internet
1:30 The old lady could be Super Skrull, but how are they gonna explain his Fantastic 4's power?
Some say the granny is Thanos
No most crazy scene in this trailer is when she beats tf out of the old lady
what a total and complete let down. come on marvel, don't turn into DC by throwing out shit movies as fast as possible. you guys are already ahead of the superhero race.
1:30 *Punches old woman with dramatic music*
Old lady: Would you like fortnite?
i dont think avengers need captain marvel now when she comes it becomes kind of dc shit that heros have unimaginable power, nonsnse just like superman said "you know i can kill you if i wanted"
I hope the old lady wasn’t a skrull
Belted grandma right in the face.
im tired of white people
Yay....another female superhero................ Now all we need is a black female superhero version of it and maybe an asian.............and errebody included, this sorta shit is killing movies!
Hit like button if u want to know who is her husband....
Where are we in dc ? She overpower thats bullshit
Why is she so boring? Want to watch the trailer again but somehow couldnt. What happened to all the fun in the Marvel. This looks like shit
The old lady may be Thanos's Mama!!! 🤣😄😆
Eminem get punched grandma!
Grandma is a skrull or was she mistaken? hahahha
Hit Like If you watch 50+ Times..!
same shit different movie
I’d hit that grandma too if she took the last seat
CM: Hold my beer
What a villain. Punching that old lady smiling at her 😭😭😭
Looks like shit. I'll pass
I really hope the old lady is NOT a skrull, Captain Marvel just really wanted that seat.
Note that this is a TEASER trailer. This is a sneak peek of the movie, not the full plot! We will see more of Carol, Nick, Phil, Mar-Vell, Ronan and the others in future trailers! So stop complaining how shitty this is. Jesus.
This looks like shit.
Did she just punch my grandma 1:30
Boi o boii *Thanos* is about to shit his pants!! 😁
Actually, plot twist... Grandma is Captain Marvel. Captain Marvel is Thanos. ;)
Damn she knocked that old lady out 😂😂
*punches old women*
It looked pretty lame until she punched that old lady. Now I totally want to see this.
Grandma Skrull KO'd!!!!
Nothing says superhero like punching an old woman in the face.
I’m pretty sure the old grandma is a Skrull who shape shifted into a human
The old lady says to captain marvel after that “I don’t feel so good”
But I laughed when she punched that grandma
*Decks an old lady in the face*
R.I.P Granny :(
That old lady though...
OMG they changed the original red and white colours just for Captain Marvel!!!!! This movie is huuuuuuuuuge!!!!
Incels taking the day off from striking out with girls in order to hit the downvote button on a movie trailer may be Peak Pathetic.
99% About a grandma
The only fight scene in the video is,  her punching an old lady in the face.....

1:30 Grandma Abuse!
“Holy shit” ~Spider-Man
Old lady, "Is your movie going to be as bad as Green Lantern?" 1:30
Why did she just punch that granny?
Cant Punch The Elderly.
She is insensitive. The old lady dun goofed.
she hits an old woman
Was excited for this movie until Larson got on her soap box to complain about nothing. No, I'm not a white male...
Reality: Captain Marvel beating up old ladies
1:30 : When grandma won't let you take a chocolate from the coffee table.
Never said this about a marvel movie but this looks like shit. I’ll watch for the sake if Avengers 4. Shoulda got Emily Blunt to play this roll.
1:31 The old Lady is 100% a Skrull!
Why is she going around punching grandmas
Why she punch that old lady tho
Marvel Studios can you please help Warner bros and DC so they can get it together like you guy's. I'm a Marvel and DC fan and damn I gotta say another hit movie.
Who else looked at the comments right when she punched the old lady
1:30 That villainous old woman looks to be more sinister than Thanos, good to see justice in action
All I remember from this trailer is that a grandma got punched in her face😰. I'm sorry, this trailer is sooo bad in my eyes...... I'm sooooo disappointed😩😩😩😩.
Oh shit here we go again
1:31 why bash the sweet old lady captain ?
Looks great so far everyone’s talking about the old lady getting punched but I’m guessing the lady is a skrull in disguise
Marvel decided to tackle the villian problem by making it an old woman at 1:30 HAHAHA
When grandma gives you hard candy instead of chocolate
60k dislikes from grandma and her crew
I don't know... This looks like bullshit to me... I hope I'll get denied by the movie
Oh look....the same old same old in the comments section.  "I totally know this film is going to bomb based on two minutes of trailer footage sliced together by a marketing team that worked little to nothing on the film itself and I don't like the lead so it'll suck big time!"  And then the day after, when it has smashed out the box office AGAIN, the same asshats will backpedal and claim they always thought it would do well.
wait why tf did she punch the old lady
Yo what about Adam warlock. He has the Ego stone and shit. And are they going to explain how Nemesis is the originator of all seven infinity stones.
Punching a old lady . I don't think that this movie is good
The grandma punch is the reason I will watch this movie
why did she punch that old women :D ??
1:30 When Grandma 👵 says she didn't liked the trailer...
Captain marvel lady look like so old... better shoot scarlet jhonson for marvel captain
Grandma *slaps Captain Marvel*
The grandma should have her own marvel movie.
0:37 see nick fury hold a ice bag or something on his left eye means he lost his eye due to the skrull
Holllllly shit nick summoned her to Earth!!
This is shit, I am disappointed with this flim😑♿
The question is Who is that Grandma
so, just so eveeyone is up to date. that old lady has to be a skrull, or its a gag about skrulls. typing this out really doesn't help looking back on it
Granny getting punched? What the hell
Holy shit!! Holy shit!!! Holy shit!!!!!
Looks like one of those shitty Netflix original movies that say they’re good and have fake reviews saying that it’s good but it’s really just a bad movie
1:31 she totally punched a grandma! I'm so ready for this.. 🤩
That Punch though 🤣
Looks like she'll go for the head - she did punch that old lady in the face
cant wait for the grandma memes
This looks like some trash DC would shit out
holy shit 1 hour early
Skrull is punching the old lady, or the old lady is a skrull. OMG TWIST.
Nick Fury: Way to punch that Skrull's lights out!
Did captain marvel just hit a old lady?
Why did she punch an old lady marvel explain is she in a simulation but if she were not she would have punched a nice old lady!
The trailer starts off so weak (crashing into a Blockbuster to establish timing is a little easy) but it gets SO good. The punching the old lady on the subway is an excellent thing to put in a trailer cuz it asks a million questions that we won't get answers for. Exactly what you should put in a trailer. And the various quick shots of her getting up in different ages was so, so awesome. Also, Bree Larson is hot AF
I hate to sound like a cheesy old lady but this shit is breathtaking, bro
"discover what's makes a hero"  *punches an elderly women*
She punches an old lady, LMAO.
Granny got stole on!!!
How you just gonna punch a old lady in the face dawg.
Shit the last scene!!!! It's lit AF!!!! She could murder Thanos with snap of her fingers!!
It's venom all over again first trailer is shit but I'm sure a few more come along and boom it will look like a good movie
1:30 When ur granny says "do  you want some more potatoes honey?" when you have already eaten 5 kilogrammes of them.
Seeing her punch that Old Woman can only mean one thing..... Skrulls Baby!!
That old grandma was probably a Skrull (shapeshifting alien).
So is everyone gonna ignore the fact that she punched an elderly woman?
I love the fact that punching a little old lady is perfectly fine in the secret Wars. I love it even more for the people who haven't read that who see Captain Marvel punch a little old bitty.
Seriously hoping the official trailer has better execution— otherwise this looks like it’s gonna be a Shit show. Come on, Marvel, at least TRY to do your ladies right 🙄
She just hit yo grandma!
i love that the logo of marvel change to that silver and gold 10 and this trailer is awesome
01:31 poor grandma:'(
*Punches an old lady*
Phil Coulson seems to be as old as he is right now...
1:31 when a stranger old lady tells you to eat salad 3 times in a day
This trailer kinda holding it back. I need more intensity. I hope they release trailer 2 sooner. Can’t wait for the film tho.
Wow! She crash landed in an old Blockbuster video store of all things! Ah the memories! Rushing to the store to get that new movie before somebody else does, paying for late fees because you kept the videos too long, getting pissed off because somebody didn't rewind the video all the way... those were fun times kids. :-]
lol poor old lady
That old lady was probably a Skrull...
1:29 Damn slappin grandma
So this is gonna be a prequel and she is eternal or something or she was buried or got stuck in something really cold like Captain America
Şehitler ölmez vatan bölünm❤
Why she hits Old woman? 1:29
I'm just hoping that she doesn't hit Stan Lee like that cause it doesn't look like she likes old people
I feel like a good 25% in the comments know about Captain Marvel and appreciate the trailer, and the other 75% have no idea what's going on and only care about the 'old lady'.
punch old women right in the face while riding the train. that's what makes her a hero.
YOU CRAZY MARVEL you can't make movie who captain marvel hits poor old lady!!??!!!!!!!??!
Also, I really hope the old women scene is one of those "Visitor from another world arrives to earth and sucks at social norms" scenes, and that she's indeed a normal human. That would be hilarious.
Why the heck did she beat up on an old lady?
Captain Marvel boards the bus and finds the old lady sitting in the ladies' seat while the Senior Citizen seats are empty.
DC Fan Hit Dislike
Grandma is Mystique Bitchesss
I mean... Which superhero would give a straight out punch on face of an innocent old woman??
1:31 bro she just knock out a granny lol
Anyone see that grandma get slapped
Is this like a reboot  of marvel universe after the infinity wars part 2 changes the entire universe...coz the SHIELD logo is incredibly old on her cap...and Fury has both his eyes and looks youngish....there are no quinjets...and captain marvel doesnt exist in the old timeline...she might be Starlord's replacement in the new universe...both have similar powers except she a lab rat for aliens and he was born a celestial being..
She punched an old lady!!!
I hite miss marvel becuse she is a super jork.
This literally looks like a shitty Netflix movie
"The marvelous space adventures of captain granny-puncher"
bet she will “cure” this thanos dust shit
Skrull infiltration as old lady's let's GOOOOO
1:40 Oh shit! I think I saw Flash!(Im sorry marvel^^)
Grandma will be the main villain in this movie
I already know that granny hitting scene is goona become a dank ass meme
Looks amazing but why did she cave the old lady’s face in 😂
They should change the title to 'teaser trailer' because this isn't necessarily an Official Trailer per say. The editing is just too jumbled up and it doesn't really explain shit.
She hella punched that old lady
I saw the trailer on good morning america and it was amazing. I can't wait for this movie when it hits theaters in march😃🎥👍
captain marvel (Mar-vell) was male. more SW bullshit.
Marvel Studios presents: Captain Punch an Old Woman in the Face. Coming 2019.
She punched the old lady because that old lady is actually a shape shifting skrull
So no one's gonna talk about the fact that she punches an Old Woman? Lol
1:30 whoever is upset about the woman getting punched, she's actually a skrull, skrulls are shapeshifters, and they're the main villains in this movie.
i bet the old lady is thanos in disguise
If shez alive from 90's then wont she age?? She should now be as old as nick fury ... As we know even celestial do get age.. As we have seen in Guardians Of Galaxy 2 (  star lord's dad )..  And here captian marvel is half human and half celestial but shez shown same age in infinity war as in trailer
Holy shit .... this is something .. incredible.
Here’s a bold prediction: in the next 72 hours the trending page and my recommended videos are going to be full of people making bold predictions based on this trailer.
Finally a trailer where they don't reveal the whole movie to you!! Just enough so you get what's going on. Homecoming is probably the best Marvel movie but was still kind of pissed that the trailers literally told you 90% of the story.
1:25 Punch that old hag! Take her seat!
Who's before this video hits the trending page 🔥!
Why she punch a sweet old lady
Punches old lady on bus, lol
Yo she just punched a grand mother!
This shit was FIREEEEE
What makes her a hero 1:31 punches Old lady to the face
Poor grandma...
1:31 R.I.P granny :(
1:32 When grandma gets the last donut😂😂
I don’t understand how anyone could complain or find something wrong with the trailer. Captain Marvel is a staple to the comics and her Power is on a scale unknown to any other hero. She is the glue that holds the age of hero’s together. You don’t call her if thanos is invading, that’s not worth her time. You call her if half the universe gets transported to the soul stone. This trailer is not meant to be a display of powers, but rather a symbol of her importance. Go away haters. Thanks marvel for making this amazing comic into a movie.
Well this looks shit..
Am I the only one who is hoping for a Winter Soldier cameo?
when u want to stop eating but your grandma keep feeding you... yeah!
Old Lady: Thor
The smell of Hollywood progressive/Mary Sue/feminist bullshit is strong with this one.
M8 did she just punch an old lady?
Omg, that poor grandma!!!!
1:31 Dang she’s like Grandma I said I’m not hungry anymore!
Old people about to get trigger by this trailer 😅
Did she just sock an old lady? Lmao..
That lady is thanos's mom, ... Punches
Damn this actually looks good marvel is starting to get their shit together
Did she just punch an old lady....
I can't be the only one who laughed when she punched the "old women"
Captain marvel : one punch man mcu version
Edit: I just make holy crap and holy shit together.. Holy crit
that grandma hahahahaha!
I need a GIF  of her beating the shit ou of that old lady for out of context purposes. Also, is SHIELD = MIB canon now?
Can’t wait for Grandma Hitman
I would not hesitate to punch an elderly person.
That old lady was probably a skrull
leave the fooking grandma alone CM
1:30 why punch grandmother
Why would she punch an old lady on a bus
Holy shit I’m ready! Take my money, just hurry and make the next avengers come out already, thanks 👌🏽
Doesn’t look as promising or as fitting as the others. Kinda reminds me of the Shazam trailer on how I really wanted to like it (captain marvel being one of my top favorite heroes) even though I knew it was shit. This trailer felt more like a teaser.
How many of you taught she was trying to save the old lady
Why punch old women laa?!?
The question is how many people did this low budget actor have to sleep with to ruin another of these constant garbage marvel movies!!!!... no I"m for real how many! Didn't know "a dime for a dozen" white girls come from space
Of the course the top ten comments are about punching an old lady in the face.
"Captain Marvel trailer will break the internet", maybe an old lady's face but beside that, preety average for me.
I already hate it. She needs to be tougher or older or something even her voice sounds like just a little girl or something?
Captain Marvel: "The threat is this Granny"
I know she's a superhero, but she just can't go around busting the faces of old ladies in metro trains.
Love how they put in Blockbuster at the start just to show how old the setting is in the movie.
Don't these ever get old.
I had the screech of a 4 year old when I saw this on trending
1:30 damn what granny do😂😂😂
Dude 1:29 those are both skrulls meaning old lady is prob one too.
hell yeah...now i want to punch a grand ma!!!
Damnnn first she blows through blockbuster then punches that old lady talk about respecting your elders
Okay granted the old lady she socks is most definitely a skrull, but we don’t see any evidence of it in the trailer.  It just looks like Captain Marvel slugs an old lady out of the blue.  I’m just imagining a newcomer watching the trailer and thinking “Wait, WHAT?!”, while the fans cheer her on.
I will watch the movie to know why she punched the old lady.
The way she hit that grandma is the way I hit the like button
Capital Old Lady Puncher
When your grandma agrees with your mom.
Im mad she snuck grandma like that =/
Poor grandma though...
can we make a meme for that old lady?
lol am I the only one who liked the part where she punched the old lady?
I'll buy unlimited tickets just to see that grandma getting punched in the face on the big screen
I  don't think any thing after infinity war is gonna be as popular as the stuff preceding it expect for the second part of infinity war. This looks like the Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern...
My second reaction:  Isn't Fury supposed to look  the same age, since he is way way old anyways?
Captain Marvel in comics look so much more badass, and way more 'natural' than this shit.
well shit, that was awesome. she punches and old lady (probably a Skrull in hiding).
admit it : this trailer looks like Ryan Reynolds' Green Lantern movie.
I’m watching this to see her hit that old lady
Shit trailer normally means good movie so i'm chilled....
1:31 *oh shit fells bad grandma*
Captain Marvel looks weak in this shit.
Hmmm. Punching a geriatric in public will most likely yield extremely scornful and unfavorable repercussions. First I was shocked but then I laughed. It's not something you'd expect, that's my shock. It's probably an alien/metahuman in disguise or something. That's what makes it funny. They're probably messing with viewers. Trailers are good at not giving too much context if any at all. Can't wait to learn the truth.
I Died😂 after she SuperHero punched that Old Lady in the Face💀😂😂 1:25
Thanos is sitting in his little shack watching this shitting himself rn
HEY! HEY! Hey old lady! FIST!!!
She hit the old woman because the old woman was a Kree in disguise, and Kree are aliens that can shape themselves to look like any being they want to look like.
If a newcomer takes down thanos then marvel can suck my balls, disney trying to push there feminist shit on marvel like they did with star wars.
Hit like For captain Marvel
WTF she punch the old ladie in the face she is mean😂😂
why did she have to mike tyson punch the old lady on the bus for?
@1:31 - She hits *GRANDMA*
Plot twist: The old lady was Thanos in Disguise and Captain Marvel wasn't having that shit.
Dumbasses think she punched an old lady.
I would feel sorry for the old lady if my head wasn't just beaten in by 90's  pop culture references.
I can just imagine the amount of 90s references this shit is going to have... and how FB is gonna be filled with it, too. Ugh.
Who felt old when they saw BlockBuster?
1:31 That Grandma hope she had a good face
What did we do to you for you to give us a granny beater?
I can't support a movie that think it's cool for it's heroes to punch sweet ol grandmothers on public transportation.
Is it just me or was this an awful trailer like I didn’t learn anything besides how to slap an old lady
Is anybody going to talk about how she punches and old woman in the face with no context
This is exactly what is missing from infinity war, somebody beating up and old lady
Discover what makes her a Hero.. *punches grandma*
Skrulls?! No wonder she punched that old lady.
Yo hwy she punch old lady
Christ! the hypocrisy in this comment section is overwhelming! Face it people this was a below average trailer tops, If you only like Marvel because of the movies thats Ok, but atleast let comic book fans like myself and others express themselves without getting a shit ton of snowflakes who will defend with their lives everything that comes out of Marvel/Disney's anus. This trailer wasn't nearly as good as most marvel trailers so stop trying to desperately like it just because its marvel. Jeez its The Last Jedi over and over again.
PUNCHES an old lady😂😂😂
Anybody that’s confused about CM punching the elderly lady, that was a shapeshifter. Don’t go hate tweeting marvel.
Little kids: why did she punch her?!
1:30 wtf why she punch that granny
Same old generic marvel movie!😂😂
1:30 When you hit your grandma
Can't wait for her to punch Thanos
That old lady just got fuckin decked
1:30 Geez the lady didnt do shit to deservive that
Okay. Now I need Kamen Rider Zi-O's Time Majin to go to watch these movies (bold indicates what I am very excited to watch:
Why people are so sensitive because she hit an old lady like  please this is just a movie
Not even 20 seconds and I already feel old.
Shit. Marvel, I expected smth more...
I feel bad for the grandma
I'm assuming that old lady was a Nazi?
1:31 When you at Granny’s and she says there are no cookies!
We all gonna pretend like she didn’t just punch an old ass lady?!?
Shazam > This shit
Wow, they really are deleting comments. Even ones that are just a discussion and not at all hate. Geez, Marvel... If it holds up when it comes out it will, if not it wont. Deleting comments wont change the outcome.
did captain marvel punch a granny.....
btw.. her punching the old lady made my day ^^
That poor Grandma! 😧
I have this feeling that she doesn't fit the role? the vibe is just dead. Can't they pick a better actress for this role? She looks like the cool mom in the movie mean girls. my god.  They might as well casted Britney Spears or Mariah Carrey for this. and if shit still no good the could have cast Oprah and let her do the talking.
RIP old lady 
this movie is going to be shit just like every marvel movie
RIP grandma..
Discover what makes a hero. **Captain Marvel proceeds to hit an old lady**
That granny is dead.
Wonder why title says - Discover What Makes Her A Hero ? Could punching old lady metaphorically mean that she can defeat her own age?
DAMM what did that old lady do?!!
Not the old lady
When she punches the old lady😂😂😂thank God it's a skrull
WTF is this shit!!!
They are gonna ruin it with the feminist shit. Like when they did the her/ hero
Is nobody gonna talk about that grandma getting SLID
Did she just smack an old lady across the face
There was nearly nothing in the trailer that was gripping or interesting (Exceptions were Nick Fury & the Grandma punch scene)
Was that jude law? Holy shit I'm sold
hit Like😈😈😈😈
It'd better not have any shitty ending like infinity war
Season 4 fortnite? Meteor hitting blockbuster. Aka risky reals?
The old lady was most likely  an alien Skrull that shapeshifted into an old human lady.
I feel old now that 90s are time traveled to
At last Marvel Just arrives and kills thanos with one punch just like that  in DC😅 RIP Movie🤣xd
Hey look its a piece of wood trying to act in a Marvel movie......who gives a shit?
Has Brie Larson got her happy man hating face on because she knows teens will be perving over her as Captain Marvel? she looks like a bag of shit in that suit and is not that good looking so relax Brie you can be happy in the knowledge 😊
Blockbuster: hello darkness my old friend
1:31 Did she just punch that old lady in the face?!
When earth is invaded by the chitauri and Loki, captain marvel sleeps and nick fury doesn't think to call her.
She punched an old lady 😂
When an old corrupt politician asks for my vote to rerun.
lul looks like shit so gimme +1
Does she punch old lady
That old woman is a Skrull, calling it now!
Why she punch grandma smiley face?
One Punch Lady soon in cinemas...
Finaly someone punched that old Lady!
Nothing about this movie or even the character makes me wanna see this movie. Except for grandma getting punched. Might go see it just for that. Brilliant marketing.
Dam hit them with the block buster
Grandma in the trailer is actually a skrull. As we know that skrulls are perfect in taking others form.
So they decided to take the Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern routes?! Lol Good luck with that lol
captain marvel punched an old lady wth
just tell me how old she is now ?
In before this hits 100,000 views.
I get to see Brie Larson crash into a Blockbuster and punch an old lady
Marvel films are better than DC but this trailer doesn't even touch wonder woman one its cold,boring & that music trying to make us more curious doesn't work looked like another tomb raider, hope this movie doesn't bury future of female superohero films for another decade like catwoman did
1:30 Insert Old Lady Joke.
She just punched an old lady!!!!???!!!
Captain Marvelina, looks like shit
1:30 She just an old woman
Holy Shit...😍😍😍
Wait, did captain marvel just a old lady?
What’s with the gabby punch?
Ohhhh so that's what it's like to bang a granny
People complaining in the comment section makes me disappointed, in my opinion this is one of the BEST marvel trailers they've made, not many marvel trailers have made me hyped, but this one certainly did. Seeing Nick with hair, AND two eyes, seeing the blockbuster gave me immense nostalgia, and not to mention that this is the MCUs first female superhero movie. I think that's some exciting shit regardless of what the intentions were. Not to mention seeing someone bitchslap an old lady is a rare sight in a movie, but not an unwelcome one.
I'm bout to punch an old lady to become a hero lmao
also the fade of "her" to a hero" was lame. keep that PC shit outta here
Old lady: OMG my favourite superhero
Don't dare to say that the old lady was mother of Thanos..
She clocked that grandma real hard on that bus xD
did she just punch a granny in the face
I just wanna see why the old woman was hit lmfao
They finally made a movie that everyone can hate on together instead of just a small group of people. It's so confusing that not even a feminist who's moist from having a female superhero as the main character can defend it since she straight up punched out an old woman with no context.
Ain't got shit on Green Lantern 2011
I’m just an old lady
Slam F on keyboard for the old lady!
This doesn’t look good.. I will watch because I wanna know why she punched granny
Holy shit....i didnt expect to see an old lady get punched
Grandma down grandma down!!!!!!!
There’s suprisingly not a lot of comments talking about how she punched a focking granny.
Holy shit...I was waiting for this so long...most powerful woman marvel has ever had..now coming to beat thanos ass... obviously in infinity war just after 2 months..cool..😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
Edit: and The Old Lady of The World😂
So? She punched the old lady for smiling at her? Damn, Brie Larson! You hate smiling that much?
Shared this trainer with my friend who happens to be a dc fan boy. I knew he'd have some problem with the movie and what was the problem? He said that brie Larson looks old!
So we’re all going to ignore the way she punch an old lady😂😂🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
All these comments about grandma. No one mentions the Blockbuster Video Store!
Hold on Thanos. She is coming.
Captain Marvel is a guy. wtf is this disrespectful progressive bullshit
Idk about the part when she punch old lady in the face other then that trailer is good
The scene where Captain Marvel hits that old lady is probably actually a Skrull
It makes sense, why she punched an old lady. She probably knows that the old lady is a Skrull since they can disguise as anyone else
Did... Did she just hit an old woman? Okie
the grandma should not have stolen the seat
Please leave Grandma alone
Poor oldwoman there... 😂
Why she punch an old woman...???
she better stay away from my grandma
People keep saying what is it with captian marvel beating that old lady it's probably a skrull cause there clearly in the trailer at 1:29
I absolutely love the grandma hitting scene it’s not some political stuff I just love that scene
01:30 a superhero thing. spanked sh**t out of that granny
1 hit = 1 prayer
How can she help the avengers if she can't control her emotion ?Poor grandma lol.
*Proceeds to smack granny*
The nostalgia of blockbuster is crazy. I remember being so happy when my mom told me we were going lol
Aww poor old lady
Wait. Did she just punch an old lady on the train?
No ones gonna talk about She punched a elderly?
When Blockbusters is used as a setting for a period piece. Man I feel old now
not upto the mark ... seems like shit..going to be worst marvel movie.. what do you think??
And here I was just thinking I wasn't gonna watch any more Marvel movies if they didn't start punching old ladies in the face.
Captain Marvel wanted that seat so bad, Poor old granny :(  1:30
99.99% of the comment section is about granny gettin punched by Capt Marvel 😂
ummm why im having doubts that she will get sucker punch like Captain America by THANOS
I swear MGK that old lady and captain marvel is Em. Mgk all smiling at papa
My favoritr part is where she punches that old lady
Why she punched grandma in 1:30? Suddenly I closed this video
according to comics , Captain Marvel is black   ...      once again Marvel studios missed the opportunity  to make a hit  like black panther  ..  shame on them !!!
Did she just punch on a grandma!? I know that maybe is just a villain disguised like a grandma... but stills impressed
Did any1 see agent coulson. I didn’t know he was tat old
Nick fury and Coulson were the best part about this trailer. Otherwise it was boring with the exception of Granny getting fuckin KO’d
Just wait.... Grandma is the key to a brighten future
This is a burning bag of shit somebody left on your front porch.
Why did Captain Marvel punch that poor old woman into the face??
This trailer is going to hit 💯 million+ views ..
just one word.... holy shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Guys let’s just remember, before we judge Carol hitting an old woman, Tony Stark beat up an 100+ year old man who just wanted his best friend back
I was sold when she socked tf out that old lady.
To all of the people complaining about the "she punched grandma" comments you have to understand that not everyone is well knowledged in comic books as you are. Movies are supposed to be able to appeal to the audience who has no knowledge of the source material.
Wow shes punching old ladies and Batman is there too!
1:30 when grandma ruin my diet.
Oh shit wrong company
now i'm going to be trying to figure out what the context for punching an old lady could be for the rest of the night. thanks for that.
Calling it October 4, 2018. Brie Larson and/or director is going to blame white males and racism if this flops.
1:36 i'm sold for only this scene !!
Did she just beat the shit out of that granny?
The whole superhero shit is starting to stink now we got some superwhore that will save earth, what is her superpower again?
Grandma is Skrull, get over it people :P
I am not excited for the movie i am excited to see for what she punched the grandma🤣🤣😂
2018: *Some superhero casually punches an old woman in the bus
Holly shit. The hype is real
Everything was serious for me til she punched that old lady lmao.
1:30 i think the old lady is the skrull
If they put her in her old Ms Marvel outfit, I'll bet it would double the box office.  That outfit is basically just a harsher version of the Cathy Lee Crosby Wonder Woman outfit from the seventies (Google it if you don't know the reference).
Well shit now I've got the chills.
Shit look like a weak tv show smallville  type lol
Legend has it that you can see her punch that old hag in the face till this day
I really want to see this for the old lady punching.
Punching an old lady 😂😂😂😂😂
Please dont Make this movie about her being a woman. Make it about her being a kickass hero. No social justice bullshit. Just make a good movie and a good cameo. All I ask
Well she has her part in upcoming avengers movie and the movie is itself so interesting so the movie will be a hit. And good luck from India 😃
at 1:31 I felt really bad for that old lady
1:30 hitting old women I liked it! :D
I have cosplayers friends who make a way better Captain Marvel than her, ofc they can't act a shit, but cmon, this is not acting either and she still doesn't fit for this role. Did they choose her cause of her blonde hair? there is tons of better options and im not even talking about her body.
I know you're a Skrull old woman!
Did she just punch an poor old lady?? 🤨🤨
1:30 When you go visit your grandma and the lunch is not ready yet
I like her better in the golden bridge.
yes, check that old womans priviledge by beating her into a coma
Loving the punched an old lady jokes.
Captain marvel is a shitty character in the comics I don't know why they made a movie about her
Holy Shit I'm Pre buying tickets
The old woman was a skrull
Holy shit... Its Blockbuster!
One Like = 1 prayer for the old lady
The grandma must be a skrull. I set my expectations really low, due to the fact that it’s brie Larson, so that I could still, if anything, watch a decent addition to the MCU and not feel like I was preached to. This trailer gave me hope that it’s gonna be a normal movie and not marvel going rogue. I advise those skeptical fans to do the same lol
The Granny was Luk.
when my old lady neighbor tells me to stay off her lawn 1:31
Discover..what makes her... A HERO!*Punches old woman in the face*
Oh shit it's BlockBuster
Laughed my ass off when I saw the blockbuster, definitely brought back some memories there... Man, were getting older guys lol
I liked the part when she decked the old lady for not giving up her seat. Classic.
one of the few trailers that really got me hyped for the movie. black panther and IW trailers being the "few". captain marvel really is setting up to be a hit. but I guess time (and the box office) will tell.
The movie starts off with Marvel asking her grandma for some of her favourite candy, but grandma says no. Weeks later, Marvel sees that grandma (who is named Charles) gives some candy to the other kids. Marvel gets very angry and slaps Charles. And That’s the end!
(After watching a scene where Captain Marvel punched an old lady) ......What the Hell, Captain Marvel?!
Fury holding ice bag on left eye in autopsy scene. Who did he trust that turned out to be Scrull.
*punches her*
Marvel movies always greater bt why they makes shitty trailers........😨😨😓
The old lady was a skrull
WHY the grandma??
Did she just punch that grandma?
that old lady should be dead by now.
did she just punch somebodies grandma in the face
I would honestly rather a movie about Shuri inventing shit and her back story than this
Remember when Brie Larson said she doesn't care about what white men have to say about her movie?
1:30 Her face before she got punched 😯
Literally everyone is commenting on her punching the old person but I’m just like ‘wOAH SHE GLOWS’
did she just punched a granny in the face ?
I like this trailer and captain marvel will be a hit. feminist or not
Well this looks shit lol
Old lady was Thanos in disguise.
So... $hit it's geting real ...Again!
What makes her a hero: punches an old woman for no apparent reason
Luckely she didn’t punch Stan Lee.
1:30 when your grandma knits you a sweater instead of buying the Gucci one you wanted
Young Nick Fury looks far better than Old one
I like the part where it says "discover what makes a hero" and then shows her punching a seated old woman.
Feminist bullshit incoming on march 8
What if the grandma isn't a Skrull in disguise but Captain Marvel is? So the Skrull punches the grandma and everyone blames Captain Marvel..?🤔
So niggas clapping old ladies now
*Proceeds to hit an old lady in the face*
1:30 Wait a minute. Was that elderly woman she just punched a skrull? If so, why didn't they include a clip of her returning to her original form?
1:31 WTF she jus punched Thanos Wife
How can i relate this to Infinity war Marvels i need an answer ..My 12 yrs old brother is askin me all the time 🤔 What about Thanos snap ???
Soooooo...punching the old lady is what makes her a hero?I am so confused right now.
I love the granny getting punched xD
This smells like it's full of shit. Damn Marvel, you know how to make shit look appealing to fools.
What makes a hero? Punching old ladies in the face that’s what
Fast forward to the present day... Captain Marvel receives Nick's message, comes back to Earth but cannot locate Nick, so she goes to Tahiti to find Coulson (& May).  Coulson realizes the severity of the situation and pronounces to unite the Avengers once again to avenge Earth.
Why did she punch the grandma
This shit look wack asf‼️‼️‼️
I think she punched the old lady but I can't tell if it's real.... SKRULL...!!
**Me watching old lady comments getting so many likes**
Wait, she just hit the old lady and nobody notice that?
she punches a old woman? omg
She really punched someone grandma ......dam
1:28 When grandma gives you food and 5 minutes later asks if you are hungry
You can't hit old people just cause you won an Oscar!!!
When non marvel fans saw the moment when captain marvel hits the old lady..they would be like" Mr   stark,I don't feel so good"
why did she punch a whole ass granny??? whyy?!?
Nice Hero Punching a gradma !
Gee even the trailer looks like shit. Dam. I'll take thanos thanks
In all my old comic cards captain marvel is a man
I still don't know what is the meaning of hitting the old woman
captain marvel : *punch granny in the face*
Why the hell did she punch that old lady?
That Old Lady is a *SKRULL*
But why she punched old lady??
Really wanna know why she punched the old lol
Just a bunch of random scenes thrown together and told me nothing about the movie. I'm more confused now than I was before.
Punching old people?
Did she just punched a old lady?
1:31 im guessing thats a skrull people don't be alarmed! ik it looks like she punched an old lady lol  (but no)
(I am Korean human 12old
Anyone else feel a tinge of nostalgia for Blockbuster Video?  feelsoldman
"we have no idea what threats are out there" Captain Marvel - *punches the shit outta grandma* ALSO 1:32 RONAN THE ACCUSER RONAN RONAN RONAN !!!
(Btw, the old lady is a disguised baddie).
I'm gonna need a better trailer, because this seems boring as shit.
Old woman got bodied. RIP grandma 240 BC. - 2019
Another female protagonist? Stop it, females ain’t cut up for this shit.
Punched old lady boycott engaged
1:28 " A HERO " -  Proceeds to slap a Granny's tooth out and doesn't feel bad. -
Real footage of old people homes in America 1:31
captain marvel:(punches) who do you think i am... of course i want a cookie!!!
Damn she just punched an old lady 😅😅
Professor Snape. No facial expressions. Deadass serious on everything. Give or take zero bullshit.
At 0:39 Nick Fury is holding his left eye with something... suspicious
Let's just all ignore the fact that she punched out an old lady on the bus. 👏👏👏
Poor old lady..........................
She's so rude !! She punched a Granny !!
I believe she punched Thanos' nanny and it just started all that freaking mess🤔🤔🤔🤔tbh I think it's true.
Behold.... Marvel's Supergirl!
total shit.disappointing
Finally, a hero that will stand up to old people on buses
Grandma: captain marvel do you want some cookies? 
1:30 she punchedan old lady hebanna!!!
I lost it with the Granny (I'm assuming that granny is a skrull)
Come on DC Comics, get your shit together!
No grandmas are safe, period.
I feel so sorry for that old lady
Click dislike justice for the grandma
Earlier that today, that grandma commented on youtube "Why does she make the same face throughout the entire trailer"
She is not old lady. She is a skull
"A hero" a punches an elder 😂
Thanos wife, punched.
Since when did Thanos transform himself in that old lady at 1:30
Maybe Grandma is not Skrull and actually just an old lady, then what?
RIP The Old Lady 😢 She never stood a chance
Seems like shit, but then again, it is a super hero movie.
Imagine if that lady wasn't a skrull and she just punched the shit out of her..
Discover what makes a hero as she punches an old lady 😂
I thought Captain Marvel was gonna beat up Thanos... but I guess she's starting first with the Grandmas
What makes her a hero... sucker punches an old lady. But in all seriousness this looks sick
I, too, enjoy punching old ladies.
Grandma memes are already happening.
I think Stan lee will shout at her when she hits the old women 😂👍
1:30 grandma nooooooo!!
WTF did she punched a senior lady!!!!!!!!!
Wish they would look for people who make fight scenes and strikes look sick (like Gina Carano in Haywire) for these roles instead of mainstream actresses specially for the role of Capt. Marvel.  That punch looked pathetic -_-' Fight scenes aren't as important as acting though for such a big budget project, but I'm sure if they actually tried looking for someone who could do both they could find someone perfect for the role.  Just wouldn't be as big a name/attraction as one of the mainstream actresses so we gotta settle for this bs (she is a great actress tho).  Some mainstream actresses have a lot of experience with action/combat movies they should of at least went for one of them'
When someone sits In your spot (punches you in the face)
Did anyone else see her just straight up punch out that old lady on the bus 😂?
This looks like shite.
That old lady is a skrull probably lol.
I'm sorry but as soon as she punched grandma I laughed hard enough to wake the dead.
The hitting grandma scene is just a distraction to compansate how bad the trailer is. You know it's an alian undercover since she came from space smh these comments
Why did she punch that old ass grandma in the face 😅
Fuckin' concept.....i DON'T know why they're producing these kinds of shit to stretch the franchise.... bloody gold diggers😵😒
The old lady is a skrull people
Man Captain Marvel is such a hero punching that old lady in the face.
Soon as Brie lets me know if I’m allowed to have an opinion on this movie I may give it a chance.  As of right now I’m under the impression she isn’t interested in my viewership.  It’s unfortunate for me that if i watched this movie I couldn’t help but be reminded of Larson saying she doesn’t want to hear what white dudes have to say about a film, not buying a ticket for the imax to think about crap like that.
Back to same old happy ending movie saga which spwaned 18 movies.{Infinity War was a master piece}
Captain Marvel: How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old lady?
Cant wait for this... shit trailer but look how cool she looks!!!
Looks good so far.  I cannot be the only one that laughed out loud when she punched Grandma in the face hahahaha.
Did she just punched an old lady ? :D Wtf 😅
Anyone watching this in 2025? Such a nice movie. Good old memories.
*The old lady is Thanos*
I'm a perv. Ok, I know. At least I'm not punching an old lady.
1:30 had me dead yup I'm going to hell imagine that being on a bus and see a old lady being punched 😂😂😂💀💀
When Grandma tries to tell you her WW2 stories
captain marvel just punched an old lady
I saw whitewalker at 1:30 .. did any one else noticed?
I can see the headlines, "Little Girls punch old ladies IN THE FACE".  Now how did that come about?
Hold up. Blockbuster? Young(-ish) Samuel L. Jackson? Agent Coulson? OMG! Is this S.H.I.E.L.D.'s origin story?!
R.I.P Grandma 😢
not gonna watch anymore bec she punched an old lady
Kinda want her to meet my grandma.
the shittiest marvel trailer ever... can clearly see they are motivated by wonder woman...
why she punch an old lady
Old Lady: Shazam is the real Cpt Marvel
Tfw half the comments are people yelling "iT's a sKrUlL!!" at other people who are calling said skrull a grandma because that's how she's (it's?) depicted in the trailer
1:30 when an old woman gets on the bus before you get off
That movement when trailer doesn't give any shit about avengers 4 😒
1:31 when grandma over bakes the cookies
Punching old ladies? I’m in
I will watch the movie just to see why she punched that grandma :{
Are we gonna ignore the fact that there's a bunch of idiots that don't know the old lady it's a Skrull because they don't pay attention to the trailer?
She punched the shit outta that old lady
I heard some talk that she’s going to be some OP af hero that’ll beat the shit outta Thanos but I really hope that doesn’t happen. I couldn’t fully enjoy inifinity war because of how OP Thanos was and I think adding another OP character to the universe would be a mistake. Basically I don’t want her to be the Superman of the mcu
For those saying Brie has no expressions, you should know the Kree race was supposed to be cold and almost emotionless so...
Pulp fiction Samuel l Jackson is all ready a hit
What a shitty fans you are. All you want is action action action and hulk smashing things and then Cap America arriving with epic music.
So we gonna act like captain marvel didn't just clock in old lady in the face,lol.
Please beautiful lady, beat the shit out of thanos for everyone who died
A 35 year old Sam. Damn it. He doesn't age.
I'm just wondering what the old lady did.
Rip grandma the threat 1:31-1:31.5
1:30 When you unwrap your Christmas present from grandma and its a PS4... box that has a sweater in it.
Captain Marvel: Hold my beer
I wanted her to have the short, bold hair like in the comics.
Looks like shit.
Just came back from the Aquaman trailer where everyone is shitting on the Captain Marvel trailer
Marvel: "hold my beer"
Looks boring to me for some reason I think wonder woman will be better then this but I'm holding off judgement until I see it looks very slow paced opposite of infinity war
Grandma: you ain't real Captain Marvel.👊👊👊
Thanos-HoldMyGlove
1:31 We’ve all punched a grandma on a bus, right?
Old woman=Skrull
She punched old lady! Lol
Chill with bunching old lady’s
Did she punch an old lady?
Not gonna lie, this is probably one of the shittiest trailers MARVEL has ever produced...
She just slapped the teeth out of that old lady.😂😂😂
I still feel like instead of a finger snap...Thanos held up a middle finger to everyone who's watched since '08. That's just me. Great movie but I'd like a light dinner and maybe a few drinks before you bend me over...call me old fashioned.
Stan lee's wife appears instead of stan lee so captain marvel punches the btch out of her
I would recommend that Marvel put out another trailer immediately that removes the confusion of the timeline, punching grandma, and not explicitly for the hardcore comic fan.
Is this a joke? " we have no idea what threats are out there".. *punches old lady in face*
Why would you hit grandma
Hey Brie, you don't need white dudes?  Any other genders or colors you don't like?
Old ladies are shaking
Damn slap the shit out of that old lady
poor old lady 👵🏻
Let’s give a subpar actress a shit ton of CGI and say she’s the most powerful suThanosper hero in the MEU.... honestly it looks ok but this is more of a politically correct cash grab... if this chick is the one to destroy Thanos i’ll literally be pissed... especially after all the development of let’s say.. idk IRONMAN.... CAPTAIN AMERICA.... THOR????... There are others who deserve this
how to make money .....write a bs script ...hire unworthy actresses / actors ...relate the shit somehow to feminism and all the brainless fat women will come shouting          ' future is female '.. a trend has started to push and make women superheroes and they all are a big fail.
Best part of this trailer is punching an old woman in the face
This movie is racist and sexist for having a white female protagonist.
She just slapped an old lady 0/10 movie
I wonder how much the grandma got paid for this
Holy shit this is beautiful
Why my girl slide a old lady like that
you hit a lady,shame on you girl 😂😂😂
Why did she hit the grandma😂😂😂
Some say that the granny is thanos
Old woman is evil so she punches the old woman?
Rip grandma, but specially rip blockbuster
Outrage Culture: This movie looks like shit! She has a bland face and stuff! Ew! Marvel is going to shit! And SHE is going to kill Thanos!? Yeah right! My fingers are bleeding on my keyboard from outrage!
She just punched a old lady 😂😱😱🙄😲😲😲
That old lady was Thanos's mother... that is why she went for the head...
What the heck? Did she seriously just kill a grandma at 1:30?
Old lady: Hello dear, would you like a hard candy?
1:30  That... that old lady...
She has one of the major roles to play in avengers 4 like iron man,captain america,ant man and black widow!!! The director told. He also told that people who died in infinity war will be made alive!!! Avengers 4 will be more shocking than infinity war!!!!!😱😱😱. Real deaths😭😭😭!!!
Captain Marvel: Hold my Beer
she hit the old lady
Blockbuster hit n Oscar nominated this trailer 😂💥💥💥💥💥
Besides that, I'm concerned about the plot deviating on her childhood flashbacks. I really don't want to see more superheroes suffering from traumas in their childhood. Falling during your baseball game when you were 6 or watching a dead cat at 10 is not relevant. She is supposed to be badass, so editors: make her badass. Punching an old woman is not intimidating. I'm sure there are a couple of cool fighting scenes: take clips from them.
On the way to outsold Shazam, Venom and Aquaman.
edited: and she punched an old lady in the face..thats rudee!!
Why would she punch an old lady? What's her problem
Avengers Infinity War: *Real shit?*
Yooo 🤣🤣 she just knocked out a Grandma. Savage level over 9000
1:30 to 1:32 is Captain Marvel punching an elderly woman in the face.  Your welcome.
I love the Captain Marvel character and Brie Larson, but this trailer didn't do much for me personally.  I don't think punching a grandma is a good way to introduce the character, even though us sweaty nerds know she's a Skrull, most people don't. Hopefully the second trailer gives us a better scope of the story. Can't wait to see Ronan again!
The only impressive part in this trailer is when she punched that old lady
**Punches Old Lady**
Okay but what if the grandma wasn't a skrull
Now i have a excuse for punching people.... I thought you’re a Skrull.... sorry.
Lol am i the only one thinking what would happen if that old lady wasn’t actually a skrull.
OK just letting you know people The old lady is a shapeshifter and that's super skull or one of his Minions just to be clear
and marvel fans will say shazam trailer is better than this shit trailer.😭😂
*Grandma: Still Thor*
She'll always be Ms. Marvel to me, Shazam will always be Captain Marvel, he was the first to have the name, and that will never change, even if Marvel bought and hold the marketing rights.
sorry marvel, But I wanna see Billy Batson Hit Puberty
1:30 when ur grandma doesn`t bake u cookies
O beat the stupid oldy get up and gives her her seat next time.
We're only going to watch this movie for that grandma scene and return of Blockbuster. Don't lie.
Im pretty sure that old lady might be a scroll.
Why did she punch an old lady in the face?
1. Fury with two eyes. 2. Blockbuster. 3, Cap knocks out an old lady. 4. THE HELMET
Plot twist that's not a skrull but actual old lady
There are always some people who hit the dislike button all the time whether it is movie trailer or whatever it is. I want to collect all those garbages and put them in a dustbin.
>punches the old lady in the face
If you're reading this listen to Xavier White - Distance ❤️❤️❤️
I'm over here thinking, "wtf. did she just sucker punch an old lady for smiling?!" 
Bangam. Tamilans hit likes
DC fans trying to shit on it already lol.
I just want a gif of Brie Larson punching grandma
She punched that old woman cuz it’s a skrull in disguise
*Captain Marvel fans hit here*
Why is she punching that kind old grandma..
Damn that looks good. Can’t wait for March. Then for Avengers 4 Thanos won’t know what hit him.
For all those wondering why she hit an old lady, this movie is based on the scroll invasion comic series.
Hold on , so she gonna do a little something in March then Fight Thanos in April and then continue military life . Whoa
This looks like some feminist bullshit
Inifnity War Part II gonna be against the grandma.
why u punch the old lady, like bro really?
Holy shit , this looks EPIC!!!
Did DC sold the rights of Green Lantern to Marvel?
I think this movie should just be two hours of Captain Marvel hitting old people.
*proceeds to punch a grandma*
1:32 When ur granny says Henry Cavill will not be next Superman.
1 like 1 punch for thanos
Captain Marvel...Hello Old Lady Do You Know Where is Avengers Now??
1:48 the moment they tried to copy DC's superman but ended up being trolled over that shitty CGI.
You can tell this movie is going to be shit
So in order to be a hero, all you need to do is punch a grandma??
Eagerly waiting. ......marvel fans hit a like .....😍
Marvel has a pretty good track record of holding up its universe full of diverse characters. I hope Brie "I do not want to hear what a white man has to say" Larson doesn't turn out to be the wrong Jenga brick to leverage this franchise on.
oh, and berated and insulted if your a normal white male.
It's gonna be a shit movie.
Is that old lady ok?
I hate that Captain Karel is random white girl.  She should've been older with an accent.  It always brings more. 
Captain Marvel is a pretty shit name, there's Thor and Hulk, Vision, Spider-man, you'd think they'd try to be a bit more creative
Why did she punch old lady I'm curious about it
OMG, Granny's a shapeshifter...
99.9% of the comments talking about the grandma😂😂😂😂😂.
She just hit my grandma like what the
When Grandma asks why you dont eat anything after you ate for 3 hours 1:30
Captain Marvel hates old people confirmed!
Why she do grandma like that tho
Holy shit they did it
I like the part where she punches the old lady.
I’ll just assume that old lady was evil
Did captain marvel splap un old lady wth???
If anyone is wondering why the grandma got punched. It's because she is an alien.
RIP that old lady.
A 22 year old female with an electronic implant to control schizophrenia struck by lightning 
Captain Marvel: *punch*
Remember when Jude law used to make good original movies instead of this simple minded bullshit?
The old lady is Martha Wayne from DC
The only criticism of this trailer that I have is the fact that the scene in which she punches the old lady was cut terribly. The camera angle should’ve covered the gap between her fist and her face. Yet, the cameraman left that wide open and you can now see the gaping punch. Either way, the cameraman should’ve helped cover the gap or Brie should’ve brought the punch closer to the woman’s face. 
I was so surprised when she punched the grandma
Punching grandma makes her a hero?
Poor old lady got slapped/punched  for no reason
I think they added the punch a lady shot in the trailer so we could separate the nabs from the actual comic book readers.
1:30 when grandma don't feed you.
That old lady obviously had it coming...
Ok it looks good. I'll give it that. Just with all the feminazi shit going around in tempering my expectations.
I may be alucinating but I think we are going to see her in binary form holy shit balls
Everyone is a movie critic now its so annoying. You can't tell shit from 120 seconds stop the hate
If you think this trailer is better than justice league  *hit like*
Uploading: grandma meme
1:31 when your Grandma keeps offering you food and won’t take no for an answer
Just a little comment before this video hits the millions.
That old lady was probably a skrull 😐
Movie: Hero with superhuman strength punches Mildred's fragile face at a velocity faster than mach 4
I think that I’m bored of all this superhero shit
Captain Marvel hit the old lady because she didn't agree with her *"WAhMaN sUPeriORtY"*
I am not gonna make jokes about that old lady ... NO... I...WILL...NOT ... Did anyone notice how she punched that old lady ???!!!!
Maybe the granny is loki
43 Million people watched the trailer so that means the old lady got punched 43 Million times
Wth she just punched the old lady!!?
Edited to add, AND ANOTHER THING! What genius in the Disney marketing dept thought the best way to show what makes this largely unknown to the general, global, ticket purchasing market SHE-ro is a shot of her, not punching an alien battle cruiser out of the sky or rescuing something but savagely twatting an old lady? On a bus... to a general audience who don't know what a Skrull is yet? SHE COMES OFF AS A DICK! NO SALE.
***The imagery of Hell (Frequently called gehenna) comes from a garbage dump outside the walls of Jerusalem. Jesus hearers were familiar with the smoldering fires that always burned there.
Those complaining about or reacting to Carol punching an old lady clearly aren’t using their brains here. The main villains of the movie are the Skrulls, a race of shapeshifting aliens. Pretty sure that old lady was a Skrull in disguise, so that means Carol is kinda justified in punching “her”.
Guardians makes this look like shit
Why did she punch the old lady
shit. now I wanna play cap marvel
Umm..  She just punched a grandma 👵
I don’t feel this trailer. It feels like a tv series production. The beginning where the sky explodes and she comes down on earth that got me but the rest feels boring and low budget. Also why would they put her in the start hitting a grandmom? I dont feel her for this role and this movie seems to be a copy of thousands of movies who keep showing flashbacks and memories ... i want to see epic entrance epic powerful scenery i want to be in awe but what i see is contrary to my high expectations of marvel
Omg she punch granny on face 😱😱
I think that old woman is the villan
1:31  when grandma turns out to be a *Trump supporter*
Now that's a shitty trailer
Hm rip grandma .
Old lady: Hello dear, are you Wonder Woman?
Now please, stop making shitty fan made trailers. Thank you
Why is she so flat on her lines? And who made the choice to punch an old lady? Who casted Brie Larson and why?
Hey guys did you notice she hit an old lady?? I must be the first one noticing it! I'm gonna comment on every video, gonna make memes about it!!! IT'S SO FUNNY SHE HIT A GRANDMA
lol she just punched an old grandma
Your lead told a certain group of people not to see this movie. So I won't be. 'Nuff said.
Holy shit young matherfuckin' Samuel. L. Jackson here!
Why is it that there making more movies with overpowered women in it? Like besides this one there are movie's out there where the girl hits the dude and he's down. Now, if it were real the dude would have stood up and knocked the b**** out. Am I right or am I right?
Rip that old lady for no reason
She came. She saw. She hit'em right there in the JAW.
"Take that old lady"
I was not going to watch this movie, but that was before I saw her punching that grandma.
Why does she look bored as shit?
Itsss gonna be litttt! 🔥 Cant wait to experience Captain Marvel uppercut an old lady in an Imax 3D near you
I'll save you from reading the comments because majority of them are AIDS infested cancer. People talking about the old lady getting hit, feminists, people so unoriginal they have to describe a meme and how it relates to the movie, a bunch of "wow 1 million like" comments, a few comments of "hey alien invasion and of course it happens only in the USA, and bunch of hate for the movie. You're welcome.
If it was not for the infinty war shit, nobody would watch this movie.
The stupidity of Hollywood is something to behold.
_Who remembers back in Captain America The Winter Soldier. Nick Fury said "The last time i trusted someone, i lost an eye."_
To the people saying she punched a skrull, she *actually* punched a granny. I'm calling it!
*Was that old lady your Mother* ?
The old woman has to be a skrull!!!
Old Lady: Hey, Are You Supergirl(DC)?
It would be really funny if the old woman is not some skrull in disguise, but an actual old woman.
Man I wish we get to see the legend in this movie and I'm talking about Tommy Lee Jones. I swear I will die if I see TLJ in here... Well the a old video of him or a memory or maybe something that I can see TLJ in it
Marvel is old hat now.
Pretty sure the old lady was a skrull in disguise. If so, then holy shit !!!!
(Hits an old lady)
Why she hit an old lady
All this time, I grew up as a kid in the 90s singing “Grandma got run over by a reindeer.” But it turns out, she was actually knocked out by Captain Marvel? 🤯 Plot twist!
Old women : he's my friend
Captain Marvel: *punches old lady
Is it only me or it doesn't look like a good movie... punching old ladies in the trailer???!!!
Ya'll are never happy. This movie is too 'women' for ya and Black Panther was too black. Yall only happy when it's a huge male white cast. Get over it.
Grandma getting punched was more interesting then this trailer
Madan Gowri fans Hit like ❤️
avengers fan hit like👍👍👍
I'm calling it now, the punching of the old lady will become a gif taken totally out of context
Impossible to fairly judge from a first trailer, but we can discuss impressions.... I'm not sold on this one. The few lines we hear the actress playing Captain Marvel deliver sound like bad acting, Mr. Jackson's character seems passive and bored, this whole idea that she's from earth maybe, can't remember and that the movie is going to be her origin story revolving around these questions... I love you Marvel, but you need to make the next trailer for Captain Marvel do more to sell me. This is six months away, I know you can give us a better trailer.
After the next avengers film. I am officially over these super hero movies. Been watching them since X-men back in 2000. At some point these movies get old and repetitive.
Y not punch grandad
Is the grandma okay tho
Immediately sold when I saw her crashing into a Blockbuster
If you guys wondering why Captain Marvel punch that old lady, She's actually one of the skrulls, Skrulls has the power to shape-shift into anyone
Am one them the 32K and still increasing. The Marvel is no more the Marvel we expect. A lady, a woman as a Captain, a Hero. Hit to an older citizen is hit to the entire grand generation.  I''m not impressed
It's confirmed.. old lady in the train is her enemy!
Man if you don't know anything about the skrulls then it probably looks really bad when she punches the hell outta that old lady
I guess nobody can touch her, I mean, she is a girl, if someone punch her face, is sexist. A Hero with the untouchable power. The strongest one. OP, nerf.
And to barettos Che’s or what ever your name was you said she looks like a generic white girl why should it matter what race she is and how is the woman suppose to look?
Damn bro. She just gave an old lady a 2 piece combo.
Dude if you pause it at 0:39, Nick Fury is holding an ice bag over his eye!!
Imagine this... She was in a state of shock after seeing skrulls that she punched the old lady thinking she was one... And it turned out that she isn't... Damn that's bad 😂😂😂
Why did she go all Mike Tyson on that old lady wtf
Microaggression! Hit him. (SP)
1:30 pls don’t bring your mom or your grandma along coz she might punch your mom and grandma
Poor old lady😥😟
Lets agree it... The whole trailer was just Carol Denver and Nick Fury mumbling some shit. I expected more from this trailer. There is no detail about any villain or other supporting characters. This was below expectations
"A Hero" Punches old lady* LMFAO😂😂
Yeah punch that old woman !
The old lady gets punched because she didn't say "thank you" to Marvel after giving her seat smh.
hit like indians
When she slapped the old lady is my favourite part lmao. Definite mood
You hear that? It's the sound of Thanos shitting his pants
Are they really about to pull some naruto type shit with these memories
This trailer told me next to nothing about what this movie is supposed to be about or what happens. Contrast that with the first Iron Man trailer. You got it with that one.
1:30 when grandma doesn’t make homemade cookies
Lmao that old lady just got glocked by Captain Marvel
Never punch an old lady in the face unless its Thanos's mother.
Why she punched grandma's face I am so curious 🤤
I Just Thank For Captain Marvel is White women.
How can you have such a bored face with all this Marvel shit going on around you. Damn Brie... damn.
That GRANDma punch 😂😂
I love this Captain Marvel. Grandma's on buses can be super mean! Bammm 👊👊🤯
Grandma punching time!
I propose that we refer to the old lady that got punched as "Granos"
She looks old 😒
They thought her punching the shit out of a grandma was the most heroic thing they wanted to showcase?
Old Lady Is Thanos, that’s why when Captain Marvel punned her she Went for the Head
The acting/writing seems kinda trash, but she punches the shit out of an old lady for no perceivable reason so instant 10/10
*punches old lady* fuckin love it!

Judging by the 31k dislikes, it seems there’s definitely a selection of individuals in that particular  group whose male egos are threatened by the very image of a strong female superhero in the MCU leading her own film. Not saying that all 31k of them are composed of such individuals but judging by the comments I’ve seen through the day and night, it wouldn’t surprise me if 2/3s of the dislikes came from males predominantly straight and white who are threatened that their all male MCU is changing. 
I'm shocked when she punched the old woman
Doesn't really hit the spot with me tbh
1:30 Grandma vs Captain Marvel FINAL BOSS CONFIRMED! lol jk
Shit’s about to go down
Soooooooo she just kinda been hanging out on earth while all this shit been goin in the MCU
Brie "Im tired of listening to white men" Larson.
Look shitty to me
She needs to smile and why is she punching an old lady. Im sure parents would not want to take their kids to see this
1:30 when grandma forgets to make you her famous double chocolate chip cookies
DC fanboys in desperation mode with the dislikes. & going to reaction videos trying to make it seem like people hate the trailer. DC continued to destroy their brand I.e getting rid of cavill who was one of the best parts of the entire franchise lol. DC fans are just disliking the video and talking shit to make it seem like the public dislikes the trailer. Truth
"How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old woman!"
She only puch the old lady cause it was probably someone I disguise
Did she just... Punch an old lady!?
Old lady : ARE YOU SHAZAM 
Tired of this superhero bull shit
I love how 90% of the comments are about that old lady being punched 😂
Granny lives matter
Şehitler ölmez vatan böl❤
I hope its good? Trailer didn't really grab me like previous marvel films. Like something is missing. But then again I didn't read the comics so I don't know who she is. Looks like a lot happening, backstory wise. She's going to be a new character to a lot of people. Hope it balances well with the action. So far I'm kinda just on board. Really looking forward to the first female in a starring role in a Marvel film. DC kicked ass with Wonder Woman. Gotta step it up. Still holding out for that black widow solo film. Her backstory would be awesome.
the way she punches the old lady.. reminds me of Ronda Rousey boxing
Holy shit, she is Awesome AF. MF this is gonna be Breathtaking.
Anyone else watching wish they were watching black widow or Wonder Woman?  Damn I’m a sexist.  This chick reminds me of a girl I dated one summer at the beach.  Dumb as a box of rocks. Like lobotomized or some shit.  Meh I’m a creep I’m sure it’ll be a huge hit
she just went straight wickerman on that old broad
You guys dont understand, brie was choose for the role after her act in ROOM. Marvel has choose the right actress for captain marvel. In the trailer told that carol danvers lost her memories, sho dont know where to start and where to do, she doesn’t know whats going on, so much preasure. Marvel wants the audience become a part of her journey to find her identity. She did it well in ROOM, she can bring the audience along the movie, the emotions that brie shows are beyond natural. Please open your mind before judging.
I wanna see the old lady getting slapped it looks funny
What does Nick Fury say at 0:45 after "Truth to be told I was ready to hang it up" ?
It’s all going well until you demolish an old woman with a right hook
Did she actually just punched an old woman? 😂
Quickly, everyone! Meme the shit out of the old lady punch!
Watch the old lady actually be an old lady
When you’re actually hungry and your grandma doesn’t have 20 meals prepared already 1:30
She just punched an old lady!!
Maybe that old lady is a scrull
What did she do to get punched tho...
May be the grandma is someone else in disguise
Holy shit, Phil son of Coul!!!
movies where a female is the lead = shit
*Plot twist. That grandma wasn’t an alien* 😂
The next C-List character to become a household name. I'm excited.
That Punch Though
She punched that granny cuz the granny made her give up her seat in the bus.
This is awesome but I kind of feel bad that Captain Marvel got to be the first Marvel woman to have a lead movie than Black Widow. I mean, there are tons of story about her like how she grew up, how did she and Hawk Eye work together before, how he trained the Winter Soldier, her past romance and how she end up working for Tony and a lot more. But yeah, Marvel said there will be a Black Widow movie but yeah, enough said.
Plot twist: 1:30 it's actually an old woman
1:31 when I’m 30 and my grandma takes away my video games
That granny got punched for asking'"are you wonder woman?"
That old lady was the DCEU.
I'm tellin you, guys! The official trailer for Avengers (appearantly) Annihilation is coming out on 29 of November! Hold on to that thought!
Don’t let the marvel cinematic universe distract you from the fact that Young thug assassinated Burt Reynolds. Keep asking questions.
Grandma: Did you get Justice League?
When you’re paranoid of what threats are out there so you punch the shit out of an old lady.
When she is punching the grandma is gonna become a meme.
Lmao thats Austin Powers punches the shit out that old lady
Old lady: WHAT THE HELL!?
The strongest Marvel character just punch an old lady. Is the lady so important to be in this trailer?
It’s probably a Skrull but to the casual viewer having Captain Marvel punch an old lady is NOT the way to market your movie.
Brie dead face Larson can't act for shit!!! so many dumb asses out there!!!!
Damn they beating old ladies now?
Sounds like a lotta hate from the female hating crowd. Movie looks good and they hit some points from Cpt. Marvel's history in there. Shame we prolly won't see the one piece swimsuit version. Still I read the comments and bulls saying, it's meh or okay and the casting was wrong. I don't see any of that. Sorry, not sorry.
In this one she punches an old lady
*Plot twist, the grandma she punched was her mom*
I had to rewind the video as soon as I saw that old woman get punched lol
Folks the old lady was like an alien in disguise.
Now I gotta see why she punched that old lady 😂😂
Awww the old lady is smiling at Captain Marvel
Jacksepticeye "Punch that old lady, IN THE FACE!!"
Did she just slap old lady with sweet smile how dare! :P
wait so its not actually the avengers its just an emotionless captain marvel punching old people
Am.......I the only one who saw her sucker punch a grandma ???......😂
Blockbuster hit implied?
shishtar shapped and slapped and grandma
Overall this trailer didn't entice me to want to see the movie. BUT I will go see it just to see why Captain Marvel socked the shit out of an old lady! lol
awww blockbuster those old days 😂
She hit the old lady because she is a skrull. Skrulls are extraterrestrial beings who can shape shift. And the skulls are also enemy of the fantastic 4. They could make a connection with that as well.
LMAO I died when she punched the old lady!!
What if the old woman is a skrull?
I think CAPTAIN MARVEL thought that the Grandma was THANOS. ;)
She just punch old woman? Okey..
For y'all hating on her for going AJ on that granny look up Marvel Skrulls and you'll get an explanation
Smiling is misogyny. Punches Martha Kent
kya chuttiyaapa h bc yeh... saala jissey dekho ussey laa rh ho avengers me.... ab avengers ki team kum cirucs ki team jyda lgg rh h..... captain marvsl sucks.... we love old avengers like Iron man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Black widow,Spiderman nd Dr. Strange also. nd that witch also.... these were gud....
She punched an old lady
why Captain Marvel punch a old lady
That grandma scene is literally gonna be everyone’s next meme. I’m calling it. lol
She’s look like shit
2. Skrull, body shifting into grandma 1:30
My favourite part is when she punched the old woman.
those granny comments are people that don't know anything about the shapeshifting skrulls in the movie
old lady was a skrull 100%
Grandma getting punched is probably the ending scene and Carol goes to jail which is why she's MIA while shit goes down
Captain Marvel, punching old ladies since 1990s.
Bruh people are talking about the grandma getting folded more than the trailer😂😂
Are you that threatened by a female led superhero movie that you’ll find anything however small to weaponize in your crusade to keep the genre straight, white and male? 
Shazam↔️captain marvel -DC          Falsecaptain marvel➡️marvelshit
I’ll say this one time: The old lady is a shapeshifting Skrull
Captain Marvel's coming and grandma doesnt matter cause c.marvel gonna change the future of all the possibilities   and bring out the one possibility making the Avengers win . Go Captain Marvel. Real Marvel fans are sure to love this superhero .
holy shit
Whiting for avenjers 4
No wonder Captain Marvel is needed for Infinity War 2. She knows exactly where to hit Thanos unlike Thor. 1:31
I'm a nitpicking Los Angelino. I love how they turned the electronic monitors into platform signs and displaying a much older Metro line map behind her as she punched grandma. At 0:28 though, I wish they made those modern TAP card turnstiles look more like garbage cans though.
Captain Marvel kicking shit out of an old lady😂😂😁😁😀
_Captain Marvel Punches Her_
what would you do if you say and old person right in front of you?
1:31 when you finally catch that old lady in front of you doing 30 under the speed limit
What I find instead: jokes about an old lady being punched
Trending #1 in Wakanda.Shit just got real.
Nick Fury has 2 eyes and in Winter Soldier he said "last time I trusted someone I lost an eye" I hope we see that in this movie
Finally... A Captain Marvel that will punch gramma right in her face.
Maybe she knew it that thanos Grandma!😂
Marvel again hittttt....
we need more superhero shit  that all looks the same, and have the same primitive plot
Loved when she punched the old Skrull lady😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
WTF she punchs an old woman lmao
*Punches Old Lady*
Punching grandma cool
1:29 Are those mfkn Skrulls? That would explain why she hit that grandma...
What if the grandma wasn't a skrull and she got slapped for no reason?
holy shit captain marvel come kick Thanos’ ass
Old Lady: There are only two genders!
Holly Shit I can’ wait this one 😩 I’m crying 😢 right now 🍿❤️💯🙌
The moment when she punch a granny tho
1:30 Captain Marvel slapped that old woman into another multiverse.
Wait,did she just slap that old lady at 1:31??
Behold Son Of Cole.
Her punching the old lady was hilarious. Who thought that would be a good thing to show during dramatic music?
40%: Captain Marvel hitting the old lady jokes.
Oh my god she punched an old ladyyyy wtf😂
Why does she hold the same face expression in all the scenes?
She's MY Wonder Woman, Not Dat Gal Gadot Piece of Shit🔥🔥
The ONLY reason im watching this is for the end credits just to get that extra 30 seconds to see what will be happening after the aftermath of Thanos... otherwise id wait till this hits a stream site in HD 3-4 months from when its released and watch it there. Smh enough with these female leads. Also the original Captain Marvel was a MAN i would prefer not being bamboozled next time.  Carol Danvers is MS MARVEL not CAPTAIN MARVEL idc what those new age comic says the only comics that matter are the ones with STAN LEES name on it that used to sell for 30-50 cents.
Did she just punch an old lady
Did captain Marvel just punch an old lady?
Where the f has she been while all the other stuff has gone down in that universe? Captain chicken shit more like it 😂😂😂
Grandma lost some teeth today lol
1 second later *beat the crap out of an old lady*
So ... it's a movie about an alien who had a past on earth that came to earth and..... punches old ladies on the train???? ...... this is a hero???? AMERICA EXPLAIN!!!😂
Its pretty funny how a majority of the people don't understand half this trailer. Why she didn't show emotion, why she punched the old lady, and all that. Maybe do some research? Maybe look it up before you start hating on it. It'll definitely help you out lmaooo
Well, shit. Marvel got my money again :/
People doubting this movie like Marvel didn’t just make Guardians of the Galaxy and Black Panther into household names.
Why captain Marvel punch a granny?
Did she punch that old lady 😁😁
I punching an old woman without context is no ok
Hit like for Eminem
Not sure if people are being sarcastic or not but you all do know the old lady is a Skrull right...right? See Marvel comics Secret Invasion for clarification.
*Maybe try aiming for the head like you did on that poor old lady*
All these practices only for punching a smiling old lady? marvelous !!
Did she just punch granny....😓
Plot twist: It’s actually just some random old lady she hits...
1:34 is that Phil Coulson oh my shits
*Grandma abuse*
Howsoever the video may be but the word MARVEL makes it hit 1 million likes!!!!
At 0:39 You see Nick Fury Holding something on his eye.
Thor fans hit like 👊
this trailer's shit but i'll still watch the movie
*old lady*: _smiles_
Terrifying old woman
_"Did she just punch an old lady?"_
*Man, how she just gone hit mary poppin's like that? She just returned.*
This old lady is scrul for sure
That old lady is thanos grand ma
Damn who would have imagined that they would use BlockBuster right off the bat to portray the past? Way to make all of the millennial viewers feel old Marvel.
The only reason I'mma watch the movie is to see why she punched that poor old lady
a chick from another planet that crashes on earth and  goes around telling people that she not what they think she is and punches old ladies on trains? Is that what people call movies now days?
Like : yes and comments:more box office hit
Did she just punch a sweet old granny ? 😂😂😂 Gangsta
Did she just knock the hell outta that old lady!!!!
Old lady got her face whooped
Grandma: DC is better than marvel
Why does she have to be white and cis gendered? Couldn't Marvel have cast a transgender woman of color? I'm so disappointed in another whitewashed character.
Captain Marvel: *punches old lady in the head*
this showed me nothing but alot of memes of punching a old lady in the face. pretty good job so far marvel :P
1:28 when winter passes white walker turns green 😂😂😂
The old lady was probably a Skrull.
I’m pretty sure the old lady is not a Skrull 😂
Hey Marvel! You want your next R Rated flick? Spider Woman! Triple agent, ties into the skrull hunting alluded in this trailer, Fury's already underground in the MCU...do it! Pull no punches!
Wonder woman was awesome... Captain Marvel: "Hold my beer".
Nobody punches granny! Nobody lol
This honestly looks shit
Phil Coulson prior to Tahiti!
Who else is gonna wait for this to hit red box? 🙋🏻‍♂️
This shit looks wack. It would be better if it was a man. I'm joking or am I?????
that grandma ALIEN slap xD
Dat shit gave me chills
Don't make her most powerful ( Because this is the reason behind Bad performance of DC, they made Superman Most Powerful and other as shit ), just keep every marvel character with a limit, otherwise...
Hit you like here if you are waiting for Infinity War 2
From reading comic books since a child, whether it be D.C. or marvel, I've learned that White people can be found all across universe...
Captain Marvel... not the grandma... cuz she punched that innocent old lady who know what might happen to her? She might get sent in jail and she’s the main character of this new movie...
hitting old women is not okay
After that shitty titan trailer we needed this
Captain marvel riding the bus hitting old ladies I’m IN!!!!
That grandma was probably Hydra 🤷‍♂️
Looks like shit, lol, this movie is gonna flop, liked the background music though 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣, RIP marvel
I think Marvel has a reason why she is acting like that. Hit the like if you thought of that too.
1:30 when grandma is not actually your grandma?
Yes I’ll be 30 years old in March 2019. Hehe Birthday present for me.
That old lady is one of my social studies teachers bruh
1:30 when grandma doesn't make the sandwich you told her to make 5 minutes ago
I don't know what was more cringey wonder woman or this, I know DC and marvel fight for a lot of stuff but didn't think this would be one of them. Also she can bloody fly why is she running and pulling herself up with one hand was that done to try and out show captain America with the on your left and holding a helicopter well hate to tell you marvel he caught a punch from cable and he's just a enhanced boy scout
Poor old lady😂😂
Get rekt granny.
The way *everything* in movies pushes anti White man hate /racism, feminazism and queerness it will probably be another failure.
i feel like when captain marvel punched the old lady is gon be a meme for some reason
Holy shit!!!!! This is going to be amazing!!!! Can’t wait
so. what kinda superhero who punches a weakling innocent wrinkled grandma?!! :D :D :D
The old woman is obviously a bad guy thats morphed into her
I am pretty sure they have a factory now for making these superhero movies. Just throw in award-winning actors from all demographics (well almost all, still no Asian leads), comic book mumbo jumbo, average CGI, some jokes and sheep will line up in the theaters to see the same shit again and again making the studio billions.
Cap Marvel be assaulting dem old ladies like Johnny English
Did... did she just punch that old lady? HELL YEAH
Grandma lives matter
Yupppp im sold. Cant wait for this
That punch though.
That was obviously Thanos’s grandma.
I like that Old Lady is a skrull
Grandma must be Loki in disguise
1:27 Hold crap that transition from Her to a Hero was friggin amazing Congrats whoever came up with that
I loved it! Can't wait .....psst I think the old lady isn't really an old lady .....just guessing!🙊 Best definitely what you would expect from this genre why are we over thinking super hero movies😐😒
Yeah, I mean that old lady was probably a disguised villain or something.... but really? LMFAO
I know she's a skrull but imagine someone with no knowledge of skrull's reaction to the old-woman punching bit.
Everyone is pissed of just because she punched a old lady. is it just me who liked it?
This “white dude” will pass on this skanky bitch’s movie
ok soo im a massive MCU Fan HOWEVER.... I've not really read any comics... can someone explain to me maybe just your theory as we don't know yet because the movie hasn't been released, but how is captain marvel relevant to thanos etc???. like everyones been saying for months that shit is gonna get real in the next avengers movie because of captain marvel.... I also saw Ronan in her instagram post.... pleas help thanks..
The time she punched the old lady. OOF
this movie is goin' be shit, you can tell that just by watching the trailer :D
So tf she hit that grandma in the face with mo remorse
Wtf. Btch just punch a granma didn't knew tht was one of her power
Beat the shit out of an old lady
Anyone else think when she punched the grandma that she was maybe a skrull
Why she punched the old woman? 😲
To everyone saying this trailer was shit, just look at how bad ragnarok's trailer is and ragnarok turned up to be an amazing movie!
The most memorable part of this trailer is her punching the dust off an old lady smh
it looks like she is punching a threatening lady
Rip my boy grandma
Every new Disney movie is bad because of the stupid feminism. For example, I really don't care that elastagirl was the main hero in incredibles 2. That was fine. But they made her say the most feminist shit and there was actually no point. Happens in almost every movie now. I hope marvel doesn't follow that, but this girl is a major feminist. Not to mention they decided to randomly release this movie on national womens day. This movie is gonna be all about feminism smh.
I don't know anything about captain marvel but she punched a granny so I'll be watching this for sure
Marvel: Hold my beer
I saw an assault on white aged heterosexual woman <---   )
1:31 what you actually want to do when you give your place to an old lady
Jesus Christ After watching the beautiful new Aquaman 5 min trailer, this looks even shittier than ever b4 lol....Geez, my 👀 hurt from this trailer....Must get back to Aquaman  ✌
She fuckin rocked that old hag
bruh this shit says blockbuster like there are no more blockbusters anymore that an Hollywood videos was my shit to rent movies and games...lol
Marvel can keep this one after her racist and sexist comments about old white men.
I am feeling like that Grandma is actually a skrull
Why tf she pushing old ladies fam??
Casually Bitch punches a old lady in the bus
Anyone who liked this video first and then saw the trailer hit like here
I was told that the Jude Law will play the Capn Mar-Vell...
I don't buy that , the whole world goes to shit in avengers 3 and she doesn't even appears and now all of a sudden half universe is wiped out she appears
Most meh trailer in MCU history for a while. Though it does have Agent Coulson, Nick Fury and granny punching so I guess I have to see it.
If there is a scene where Carol just goes around punching people that she thinks are Skrulls, it's worth the price of admission alone.
Grandmas probably a skrull
I hope I don't get labeled a sexist, fascist pig, but this looks meh at best. Young Nick fury is fun. He was about to retire if it wasn't for captain marvel, id like to see that story more than captain Marvel's story. Though I do want to see what lead to the old lady getting her face crushed in by that punch.
Did she just punched an old lady
Hit like if u dont want sole movie of any girl super hero
Love the woc in this! Tho why can't captain marvel not be white...
Shit trailer but hopefully the movie won't be
Poor that old lady
I hope we'll see how Nick fury loses his eye p.s. The old lady is a skrull
The old lady was the villain the whole time!
WHO'S UNDER 1MILLION Hit 👍
Holy shit 😍 This looks amazing
Can’t wait for the movie ,want to know why she knocked out a granny:D
Marvel I'm glad ur taking our advice and holding back on the trailer.
*Punches old woman*
When she punched that old women.. that's when I started loving her🤷🏻‍♂️😂😂
blockbuster hit me harder than she hit that old lady
Why did she punch a old person
Good thing it's a movie. U give a woman that much power in real life. All the bad men in history will be nothing in comparison. Cause when a woman goes bat shit crazy (& they alwyas do) she could destroy the world in a day & apologize later when it's too late. Always happen.
1:30 When grandma's chocolate chip cookies turn out to be oatmeal raisin.
lmao she socked that old lady
Captain marvel you farthole why did you punch my grandma?!
Old Lady on a Bus, confirmed main villain of this movie
*immediately punches an old woman in her face*
Hope punching the grandma becomes meme able
Please oh please don't ruin Marvel like they did with Star Wars... no PC bullshit otherwise RIP Marvel
I don't get why people think that this trailer is bad to the point they joked that this looks like a fan made trailer, like wtf? This shit is already epic i can't wait for the film!! Cap Marvel is my new fav hero beside Iron Man, Dr. Strange, Spider-man, and Thor lmao
wow why you hit grandma
What is the problem of punching a grandma in the face, when a lot of men and old men have been punch in the face by women and men superheroes and none complained about it.
the best part was her punching an old lady that made me smile
Iron man fans hit like pls 😍😍😍
When you punch an old lady *captain marvel noise*
Shit is about to go down😱🔥
1:31 She is either a Skrull or Captain Marvel just simply likes abusing old people
Punching the old lady pretty random if you don’t understand the lore
*"* I didn't hit Granny. It's not true, it's bullshit, I didn't, I did naahht.... *"*
Looks like hot garbage. She also has no shape. Why can't we have curvy, sexy white women in movies anymore?
I'm a huge marvel fan but this trailer was kinda shit
Ayyyy she landed in a blockbuster who here is old enough to know the good old 2000 stuff
1:30 Captain Marvel hates Grandmas confirmed
Whe she slap an old lady?
She punched that poor old lady
Old lady gets punched in the face???!!!!
1:30 when you're trying to give your seat to a hot chick across of u but the old hag holding the bar next to u thinks otherwise and beat her to it
Why is she punching that old lady XD
Shit is going down boiiiissss
1:30 when you catch that racist old white lady say something bad about you
That grandma is dead af
I can't watch this. She punched an old lady. Not a superhero would ever do that.
1:30 when grandma calls you by the wrong grandchild's name
That wet fart sound you heard..? That's the world collectively not giving a shit!!
who is curious about the grandma?
The old lady Captain Marvel had punched on the face
1. I don’t see any social justice bullshit in here therefore I am relieved 
*Grandma has left the chat*
I'd hate for an awesome franchise to go up in flames due to shit writing and politics....again.
Rip Granny: 1867-2018
Marvel make some shite now
Maybe the old lady that Carol punched in the face was one of the skrulls. I thought.
The grandma was a alien you saw that is a skrull that means captain marvel enemy is super skrull from fantastic four paused at 1:30
1:26 '' a hero '' then goes on to punch an old lady on the train.
Eat shit Wonder Woman
Can't stand this forced gender shit. Just let the character be a hero. We don't need *A Her O*
I wonder how if Thor or Hulk is fuckin hit by her, what happens next ...? 😱🤷‍♀️
( and she mad cuz she punched granny in the face )
Did any one notice she hit an old lady who was mostlikly a skrull?!
That moment when she punches the old lady 😱
Damn she out here punchin old ladies. A true hero
Another Samuel Jackson hit movie
I think that granny is skrull😋😋😋
Her expression is the same in every shot of her on this trailer that has told us absolutely nothing.. but she won best actress for it so we must assume it's an awesome movie! Right..?😕
old lady got rekt. Ez pz gg
To be honest, they should have not shown her punching the old lady (yeah I just found out it's a Skrull) after saying that she's a hero.
1:31 when grandma doesn't give u a biscuit
Punches smilling old lady in the face
can't hold for a long time to watch the movie 👍👏👏
press F to pay respects to the old lady
100k views within 10 minutes! Holy Shit this Fandom is crazy! Glad to be part of it! ❤️
Already looks shit.
I wasn't sold until she punched the old lady in the face
I will say im not that excited for this movie, BUT when she hit the old lady i lost it😂😂
Cap fans hit like
Wanna know why this trailer is bad? Tell me, if you were a person who knew absolutely jack shit about captain marvel, explain to me why this blond lady from space punched an old woman straight in the face.
Grandma give me your seat
Behold marvel’s first flop. This shit is going to fail so bad.
Did Captain Marvel just punch an old woman in the face?
Smells like bullshit.
People with too high of expectations for the first trailer for what was an obscure character in Marvel. Shows you how far this franchise has come. Award winning directors. Award winning actress. Let's hold back the hate, 7 months out, shall we?
Old lady : Billy is captain marvel!
That poor old lady😂😂😂😂😂
*Punches old lady*
I was watching so much fanmade trailers. Holy Shit this is actually the real one :O
I'm paying just to see the geriatric punch on a big screen..
Captain Marvel hates old people.
Thor: Can you hold my hammer?
* punches old lady in the face *
That old lady totally deserved it
I can't believe Captain Marvel beats up an old lady, what a great role model, guys.
Bring me Grandma!
Why did she hit that old woman?😂😂😂
1:30 that did she just suckerpunched a granny lmao xD 
1:46 holy shit!!!  She going Binary!!!😱
Old lady smiling...
Grandma, NOOOOOOOO
Wwooww..............this looks like ABSolute shit. I just hope im wrong.
Yoo is anyone here wondering what the Old lady did to deserve the punch?
Where's the part where she decks the grandma
So its a Cosmic, Female, 90s Winter Soldier movie?
Cap. Marvel hits the grandma.
But still dont understand why she would hit an old lady
I hope the old lady isn’t a skrull😂
Hit like for thor🔥🔥🌩️🌩️
Why she punch the grandma in her face?I feel so sad...😭
I hope we don’t ignore the fact that she punched that old lady
Hit like if you know this movie is going to be awosome😀😀
Doesn’t look that good tbh. People only care about this shit cause ‘she’s a woman’
Old Lady was a Skrull you bandwagons
Thanos figures out about the time-jumping Avengers, and uses the time stone to start chasing them.  At this point it is revealed that they're all moving backwards through major events, the final one being the Battle of New York from Avengers 1.  Once they get the Tesseract from Loki, they'll have all 6 stones.  Thanos shows up, leading an army.  EVERYONE is here now, including both young and old versions of Characters.  Hawkeye & Ronin, Old Steve, Professor Hulk AND Hulk, 2 Thors, Rocket, and Nebula, etc...  Giant battle ensues, in space, through the other side of the portal, and in New York.  Captain Marvel wields the Gauntlet against Thanos.  Eventually, the full power of BOTH GAUNTLETS are used against each other (in space), where they destroy each other (and presumably, their wearers).  The battle over, past Avengers bid farewell to Present.  Tears flow when everyone says goodbye to Steve, knowing he'll be dead when they return to their time.  Old Tony promises Steve that he'll get the dance with Peggy Carter that he missed.  They leave back to their time.  Steve tells young Tony he should give it all up for Pepper.  Tony contemplates this.
wahman shit film
Who's here before this trailer hits a million views? 🙌
did she just punch an elder woman?
Oh shit, it's Green Lantern.
So we punching Grandmas ?
The old lady secretly told her DC is better
Okay, really though, why is she punching a random old woman. It's probably an enemy in disguise, but even then it's not really benefiting the trailer in any way. It also takes away from the specific moment in the movie because now we'll be looking for it.
I will now punch ladies on trains and call myself a hero :)
Im trying to see genis veill come back not this bullshit
wtf why she punch that old lady
I thought captain marvel was suppose to be a man?. I grew up watching captain marvel and I remember him being a man. I am so sick and tired of all these politically correct feminists movies that make the women to be tougher than a man and the hero and the man to be the bad guy. Especially if he is a white man.  I would like to see how you broads do when the shit hits the fan in real life. Your not as tough as you think and your tits and ass are only going to get you so far and then your going to need a man’s help. Stupid broads.
Captain Marvel: *Punches an old lady in the face on a train.*
Old lady : I don't feel so Good
lost it when she punched out the old lady.
Damn, she just punched an old lady, unless she was a Skrull at which case..
you can rest assure that captain marvel is going to  be far bigger hit than that stupid accented dumb stripper wonder woman.Just look at how marvel movie collections are far better than dumb stupid dark dc movie collections.Also dc needs to get some good directors for their films like jon favreau,russo brothers,joss whedon who gave marvel its biggest hits.But instead dc is stuck with dumb directors like zack snyder who doenst know anything about good film making.
More women empowerment shitting out of hollywood. Let's hope it focuses actually on the comics.
Is nobody going to mention the fact that she punched a smiling grandma in the face?
That poor grandma. She didn't deserve that.
Punching old lady
Why she slept the old lady can Anyone tell me plz
Hopefully we get more 90s references in this movie, such as those giant shoe box cellphones, classic Nickelodeon cartoons, Gameboy, Pokemon, Backstreet Boys, Old school Nintendo, VHS cassettes, Beavis and Butthead, Boom boxes and...... so much more
The thing that ruins it is the part when she punches that old lady in the face 👊👊👊
YEAH, take that old granny! Right in the kisser.
signed in just to down vote this, the recipe for this movies is 10 years old.
Jeez that poor old grandma makes me wanna 😭 
Her going Binary did it for me. I'm sold.
No one is talking about that lady that “captain marvel” punched?
1:30 and she slapped an old lady thinking she was a skrull lol probably  was or just for laughs
she out there punching grandmas i’m sold
So you tell me that this piece of shit will save everyone in 2019?
Ragnarok, Infinity War, The Avengers, The Winter Soldier, Civil War. That's my Top 5. I enjoyed all their first trailers. Not this one. Not once did we chuckle here. Filler episode?
Sheila puch my grandma ftw...Marvel are you ....damn that is my grandma ohhh lord
Imagine if the old lady she punched is Loki..
I feel so bad for that old lady, she better be skrull lol
Ohhh shitt this is coooool 🔥🔥🔥
1:30 when grandma forgets to send you a check on your birthday 😂
She just punched an old lady.
She knocked the shit out of grandma.
Just another shit superhero movie. Move along, nothing to see here.
*Punches grandma* I DONT LIKE COOKIES
Poor Grandma 😂😂😂
1. Why the f is she punching a old lady
Skrull punch at 1:30 is about the best thing in this trash
2018: we have super heroes punching grandmas
Let the Grandma memes commence
This was shit. By the way, Captain Marvel should've had a man actor. More menacing and better. A woman? Not as good because her acting isn't that good (this trailer also sucked). Marvel kinda running down but that okay.
Wt shit , they made it out like Starship Troopers or somethin'
55k dislikes from people with shit taste in movies
This shit will be good
Mom grandma died on the train by a punch by a lady wearing blue!!!! Captain Marvel=Menace!
guess  skrull was hiding as old lady
We have no idea, what threats are out there! **Captain Marvel hits an old lady**
1:31 poor old lady.
holy shit i shit my pants
Is grandma was a skrull
Yes it has changed and for the better. Heroes like Black Panther and Captain Marvel will help extend and expand the MCU. If it stayed within the realm of the all white male club, the MCU would implode.
Punching Elders is apperently a Hero thing now. *Nice Revolution Deadpool*
this shit looks like low budget series quality movie
*Punches grandma in the face*
Rip for old lady
Did she just.....sucker punch an old lady lol
Plot twist: Grandma=Thanos
oli shit XD skereeeeeeeee
She punched the old lady for mansplaining what a Mary Sue is, and then manspreading on the bus, which are both violations of the superspacefeminist code book.
Rip old lady on the train
We all know that sweet old lady is a Skrull
Finally, a hero that can punch an old lady in the face!
Punching grannies? Okay I'm in
Why did she hit the poor old lady
How long until the granny punching becomes a meme?
Idk why people are upset that we didn’t see huge spoilers as if knowing and seeing what will happen beforehand doesn’t take the magic from the actual movie. I’d be concerned if they DID include a bunch of crazy scenes, especially since this movie is meant to establish a new character, old characters’ origins, and a completely different time period as opposed to just inserting a character we already know about in a setting we’re familiar with. I think it shows a lot of promise and I am sure the next trailer will reveal more about who she is as a person because we didn’t get to see Brie act very much, and it makes perfect sense as to why given the fact that there are just way too many things to cover. Think of this as the foundation of which everything else will build off from. I personally really loved it and I’m so, so excited to see how this connects to avengers 4.
I got goosebumps. The score, seeing her team, (of course, the old-lady punch), and the sequence with all those memories from different points of her life...wow.
For those of you who comment on cap marvel hitting the old lady, here is the spoiler
That grandma had it coming.
Thats old lady is Loki 100%
The whole fighting against sexism bull shit is now making me think this movie will put politics over story. Doesn't even address the criticism. Serious? No. It was no emotion. Plus male superhero movies have been criticized for being too serious so I call BS
that is so damn good... are she really hit granny? :v
Please don't be social justice bullshit please?
was the grandma a jew?
1:31 she punched a granny  how dare sheee hmmfhhhh
Her greatest enemy isn't Thanos...It's that smiling grandma
What if the grandma was a actually a human 😂🤣
Holy shit, the hype is real let's goooooooo
Grandma has 1000hp every like Will give 1hp can we save grandma?
Honestly I'm not sold. After an awesome trailer and movie like infinity war this trailer is very subpar. Hope the next one gives me the chills and excitement like infinity war did.
1:31 when u want something but your grandma says no
The reason this sucks is because besides those who read the comics or bothered to stay after credits of Infinity War and then research the meaning, we have no idea who this person is or why we should care. It’s like having a Black Panther movie before Civil War/Winter Soldier.
Captain Marvel, yeah.... punching the shit outta and old lady
1:30 when the old lady driving really slow won’t move over to the slow speed lane.
So Jules went from Hitman to director of SHIELD.
I'm gonna assume that old lady that she smacked is evil😂😂😂😂😂 Otherwise poor grandma 😩
everybody gets interested in the hero punching an old lady
She just socks that old woman hahahah
Captain Marvel: *Hold my Beer*
1:32 did she smack an old lady
Woah she knocked that old lady good.
oh shit a prequel
Captain Marvel: Shtfkp *punches Granny in face.
Whoever made this trailer needs to be fired because it looks like shit. You show her punching out an old woman? wtf? We all know that is prob some bad guy in disguise but you didn't show that so it just looks ridiculous. It feels like a parody trailer.
I'm hoping that old lady is an actual old lady.
I would hate to be that old lady
This one needs to hit the scrap floor. What a waste of film and money
I guess grandma had it coming
So for the general public, maybe her punching the "grandma" isn't a great introduction. But I am psyched for this! The mohawk!
Holy shit perfect timing!!! I just finished watching infinity war super sad!!!
bet this will be shit.wonder woman is far better and better casting
(my grammar is shit)
I love the inclusion of the mohawk hairstyle/helmet thing as well as the older style one.
1:28 *A HERO* "punches grandma in the face"
Captain Marvel might actually have a chance at beating Thanos, just give him a strike to the head just like you practiced with Grandma.
Great a superhero that punches old ladies... hard pass, skrull or no.
Why did she just snuff an old lady bwahahha - 1:30
Um...did Captain Marvel just punch an old lady in the face in her first official trailer?  WOOW....she's gonna fit in GREAT with the Avengers.  I'm pretty sure even Black Widow would spit on her for that.
Also, loved the Blockbuster Store... old good times back then and Coulson and Fury omg<3333
That old lady slap
The Old lady just got socked outta nowhere
Marvel is punching old ladies now? 
Just punched that old blue hair.
The old lady is a skrull
50% of the comments are about the grandma.
Hit Like for hulk😋
This trailer honestly doesn't look good. I mean it's got the special effects and shit, but if the story is legit "I'm an alien. I'm remembering my past. I fight guy from my past" cleche than I ain't watching.
Come on, Captain Marvel. Give that punch to Thanos and not that old lady.
I need an explaination for why she punched an old lady
The old lady lmao
Fist pumping and jumping marvel just keep bringing hits
Wow, DC couldn't even hold on to the Captain Marvel name and have been forced to change their hero to Shazam. And they got one of the sidekicks from the Thor movies to play the character.
wait why she punch a grandma
RIP, Skrull Granny.
- Bri Larson punching old lady in the face
Why did she do the old lady like that????
For everyone hatin cuz she punched a old lady ITS A GODDAMN SKRULL
Movie looks like directed by fast and furious director.. Gonna be a shitty movie and being a marvel fan for long this makes me sad.
Can I hit that like button 1000 times?
damm she just knocked out an old lady!!!
Not really feeling this one. Could just be the racist star telling white people not to see it, could just be the disconnect between the awesome music and boring scenes in the trailer.
1 sub for old grandma
looks like shit.
Not gonna lie CGI looks so far shitty but hopefully I’m proven wrong.
I feel like the reason this trailer is meh is because the film is probably gonna set up quite a bit for post Infinitiy War, as in they're purposely holding back. Because as we all know, some serious shit happened in Infinity War and there's probably gonna be some plot points presented that adds a lot to what's gonna happen. I know our expectations are really high after seeing Infinity War, but this is probably one of the "Low Tide," but crucial movies that still adds a lot to the MCU.
This is miles better than that shitty ass Wonder Woman move 💫💦💫
Yay another white blonde blank female lead! you go girls!
Doesn't this kind of mess up the MCU since everyone always says that once Loki arrived it all changed but this shit happened before and no one talks about it?
Hit like to die instantly. 
Did she just punch an old woman in the face
Shit looks Green Lateran 2...  yawnn...
Stan Lee is probably sitting near that old lady
1:31 When your grandma tells you to stop playing Fortnite at 3 AM and go to sleep.
This is bullshit. best spidey
I think it will be looking nice to see When she get Punches bt THANOS.......
just watched video 43 times now, amazing amazing  but pls polish her powers better with CGI, her hand blast on top of train looks cheesey and like old CGI tech
Finally.... Hit like for her✨
A shity cgi at the end WOW
*punches an old woman*
When Grandma says you can’t have any more cookies: 1:30
"I'm not what you think I am" 1:45. Hmm is she a superhero or an old lady puncher
Lol everyone are talking bout captain marvel punching an old women face 😂😂😂 btw very excited for this movie
Absolutley shit without sound...
Did she just punched an old woman... :angry emoji:
I'm really looking forward to this movie but it will be a cold day in hell when i acknowledge anyone aside from steve rogers with the rank of captain
1:31 me when I try to explain technology to my grandma for the fifth time and she still doesn't get it.
I can’t be the only one thinking this looks like shit
can she punch me how she punched that granny
Holy shitttttt!!!!!!!!
She's not poor, she's not innocent or old, she's skrull---an alien villain who can shapeshift
Let’s hope it hold up.
she's going to have the old lady crackling dry voice females always seem to favor these days.  BORING.
She punched that old woman 😂😂😂
Thanos: No shit!
No offence to marvel but like I’m prob not going to watch this movie cuz it looks rlly bad... though I would watch captain marvel slapping that old lady 100x
That grandma really does look non human tho terrific scene work
Why did she punch that old women
It's like that scene from Austin Powers.  "That ain't no grandma man.  It's a Skrull Baby!"  Anyway, look forward to Captain Marvel and see the reason why Fury called for her in Infinity War to kick Thanos' ass.
Grandma: do you know the release date of avengers 4
I hardly see any comments about the grandma just being a good person and then she gets punched in the face because Ms marvel over here didnt like her
1:31 got me wondering if that old lady still has her teeth intact🤔🤔🤔🤔💭💭
When you're watching Bold and the Beautiful and your granny changes the channel... @1:30
99% comments about grandma
*proceeds to show Captain Marvel punching an old lady*
hugh Brie Larson doesn't know how to punch. Also, why you gotta kick a dead horse in the guts? Poor Blockbuster.
1:30 RIP old lady lmao wtf
Well shit that looks awesome.
I'm sick of your shit, grandma!
*smiling old woman gets punched"
old lady got knocked out is the best part ...i don’t get much excitement in my life sorry.
holy shittttttttttyghftryjnnjudssrujkllmmrff
Grandma must be something,not of this world....
Holy shit! she just belted an old lady commuting on a train
Is it weird that the most exciting thing I saw in this was an old-school Blockbuster Video store?
Prediction: The old lady actually wasn’t a skrull. But she thought she was. And this will be a dramatic moment in the film.
You had me at punching old ladies. Finally a movie that has the balls to do it.
Blockbuster,  old good times.
i tought this was a feminism movie until she punched that grandma right in the face
She did to grandma what thor should've done to thanos...  she aimed for the head
Shut up sexist. If this were a new all powerfull avenger male you would not bring this shit up and you know it. Jeeez
rip grandma 2019-2019
The highlight of the whole trailer was Cpt Marvel punching the shit out of an old lady
I liked when she punched the old lady.
Captain Marvel: punches old lady in the face
Who needs an infinity gauntlet when Ms. Marvel curbing the human population way before him.  RIP Grandma.. ye pies will be missed.
Eh looks boring as a drying piece of shit on a hot sidewalk, too bad all the rights to their best female super characters were held by other companies for such a long time. If I was in the lead and a woman id have argued over which suit id get to wear  because the War Bird costume is much more pleasing to look at and way more iconic than this dumpy multicolor potato sack of a flight suit shes wearing. Would it kill Brie Larson to show some emotion even that smile in the car and her glowing eyes at the end with all her energy felt like watching a dead fish.
God, yes. Please put more old lady punching in Marvel films.
Punching Grandma's since 2009.
Marvel turned to dogshit in 3...2...1
Looks like absolute shit
Scrolling through the comments to see why she punched a grandma
Other super hero movie. Dont yall get tired of this bullshit?
At the beginning of the trailer showing her land in a blockbuster made me realize how old I am
and she had to hit a grandma
The old lady was Mystic
Ok, a movie about a woman that hits old ladys...
No skrulls cept old lady...too much of her trynna look badass(weak acting?)
pinching the old lady would be better with context
Wtf is this ? No expressions , no shit
Tbh, I was not excited about this movie, casting, etcetera. Then I saw the blockbuster store and yea now I'm sold. That's all it took.
Carol:punches in face
Grandma, don't play a victim while she's on period.
Ok, I know Brie Larson has zero screen presence, but was it necessary to make her look like she's hungover, 43 years old and kind of ugly when she's not? Besides Carol is supposed to be a pretty and feminine woman who can kick ass... well the real version of the character, not the feminazi supreme who's been paraded in comic books these last few years.
Hit like if you love Thor
I hope that old lady in the end isnt spiderman's grandma or we"ll have another civil war
I'mma wait until this comes out on Netflix. Captain Marvel doesn't have a pixie cut. So, that means that this is going to be a cookie-cutter flick for little white girls that can't relate.
punch a skrull?
the grandma is a skulll
Granny the game has released
1:30 me and my grandma everyday
She punches that old lady like a boss, lol 😂😂😂
Outfit Department: Oh shit!  I got you fam I got you.
hits ya with the 90's right outta the gate next thing you know Carol will be watching Fresh Prince and trading pogs with Nick Fury
i will guarantee watch this movie only so that i know the reason why she punched that poor grandma's face
is it me or I just saw Captain Marvel punched a Grandma?!?!
i want her. to punch me. in the face.
what better way to advertise your movie than with a punch to an old lady's face
At 1:29 DID SHE JUST PUNCH A OLD LADY IN THE FACE?!!?  😂😂😂 OMG man am sorry but that shit was funny
Who is not satisfy .. that she punched poor wick3d grandmaa
I hope they don't fill this with feminist shit
Other half: I think the grandma is a skrull
Everyone’s talking about the grandma instead of the trailer
Watched this with my niece and all she cared about was the grandma getting punched 😂😊😂😂
1:30 Granny abuse
The granny was a skrull in disguise lol. Either that, or she is in trouble
Did she just punch an old woman in the sub way?
Which is worse? Grandma getting run over by a reindeer, or grandma getting punched in the face by Captain Marvel? One's a song, the other is bound to become a meme if it hasn't already.
That poor old lady though (I know that the old lady is a skrull btw)
She sounds like a 12 year old girl...
You know it is 2018 when ALL main characters in an american movie are either female or non white... But I'm perfectly confident that this era of political correctness is quickly drawing to an end...
The old lady was a leftist!” Shifter their everywhere. The eyes are the windows to the soul; or in this case none could be found! Punch
can't wait till find out why she punched that old lady.
That old woman she punched had to be a Skrull. No doubt in my mind.
wtf an old lady.... im done with this
Why did she punch grandma D:
Holy shit they made Coulson look young. Great job.
rip grandma 1:28
I hope to see someone edit the 1st issue cover of Captain America where cap punches Hitler with Captain Marvel punching the old lady.
can someone explain why the elderly was punched?
1:31 Punching a grandma. 
Pretty sure the old lady is a skrull
1:30 when grandma promises money for your birthday but breaks the promise
Movie going be shit
are we just going to breeze past the fact that she punched an elderly woman on the bus?
My Dad probably thought this was a *fake* trailer because Captain Marvel hit an old lady :P
Oh she punched the old lady because she's an alien. Okay well that makes sense now
Can't wait for that punch
*punches old lady* now that's a real hero
Guys the grandma was a skrull they have the power to shapeshift smh idiots
Also, would it be funny if it turns out the old lady she punched wasn’t a Skrull but in fact just a grandma that was heading home on her birthday after picking up groceries?
thor didn't aim for the head but cap marvel did (grandma's head) . be careful thanos
What the shit is this???
That Grandma is a SHAPE SHIFTING ALIEN CALLED A SKRULL, you know, the aliens nick fury talks about at 0:37
Lol, she punched an old lady
Larson punches old lady(Skrull) in the head
She punched a poor granny
Grandma in the train?? is that skrulls??
1:31 Grandma no!
Samuel L Jackson sounds pretty good and RIP grandma, she got punched by a "hero"
Old lady: wasted
(Punches old lady in the face)
In that last scene when she stands it look like a metal arm. Winter Soldier? I can’t see clearly. What y’all think?
For the love of all things holy I hope that old lady was a Skrull
10 years later, this shit better be amazing
why she bitchslap the grandma tho
Wow, she just punched an old lady through lol
Looking forward to help Tony Stark. Hit like if you like their Combo. 👍👍
The grandma is probably one of those shape shifting monster antagonists.
She fuckin ooofed that grandma
Yup, she definitely punched the shit out of that granny @1:30
Beats an old lady..........NANI
I bet the old woman was a fake
A friend of mine said that she doesn't know who Samuel L Jackson is, then i told her that if she see's any movie,the black guy in the movie is Samuel L Jackson.
men spend months in the gym to do capeshit
Montage of cute white woman's face, no action scenes.
Why she bet that old lady 👵🏻 ass like that?😂
*Grandma Has Left the Lobby*
Did anyone else see her casually sucker punch that old lady????
She punched that granny that's sick🔥🔥😂😂
Punching a smiling old lady in the face ... best trailer ever.
I can already smell the hate rising against that sexist movie critic that doesnt like something and that *has* to be because he's a white cis gendered male from a Western country.
This is going to be a shit movie sorry marvel but your trying apeal to the media way to hard
Dayymm Dat Punch !!😂
that solar flare punch in the air man
Another steaming pile of metaphorical horse shit
You punched an old lady, I’m howling 😂
That old lady was a skrull thats why she pucnched it
For those complaining about her punching an old woman, that wasn’t an old woman. It was a Skrull (shapeshifting aliens).
The fact that she falls in a blockbuster is kinda gold. Lets go Danvers
Just because the lady she punches is old that doesn't mean she's a Grandma! You people make me sick! So quick to judge and discriminate
She will defeat Thanos with one Punch 👊💨💨 haha..
totally unbelievable.  white and a female
Shit I'm excited to see Coulson
Who Satisfied this Movie Story then Hit for Like Button for Your Reaction this Movie Story About.
Hi, maybe someone is interested in watching movie tops? true video in Russian) I will soon write subtitles. hold m
saw the trailer before it hit 500k mark...
Im pretty sure that old lady was a Skrull who s with me?
Movie: *Carol punches an old woman*
Marvel Army India Hit Like 🇮🇳🔥
In case your lost about 1:31, the old woman is a Skull. Skrulls are an alien species with the ability to shapeshift into any person.
Grandma: Ow! WTH is wrong with you
zzzzzzzzzz more gender politics zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  far-left shit !
Obviously the old lady is a disguised skrull.
DC fans hit like if you are watching this.
capt.Marvel: punch!!!!
But she punched an old lady.......
"What are you going to do, hit me?"
If I punch an old lady do I also get crowned a hero? Was it this easy all along?
1:30 Old Lady who is a skrull
Nothing “funny” about punching an old lady.
So the only "action" in the trailer is her beating on an old lady? Marvel IS gonna eat its 4th L
See pubg grandma knock with punch
Why she punch old lady
Wtf.... why would a hero punch a grandma smiling at her wtf
Marvel hasn't done wrong since AOU - I'm pretty confident this is going to be a hit come March.
Yay sexism! The future hates white men
*Why the hell she punched the old woman*
People are talking shit but don't start whining now guys, we still have the Avengers 4 trailer to wait for, so hold your horses before quitting
One good example is Thor, who levelled up once when Asgard was destroyed in Ragnarok, levelled up again when Loki/Hemidell were killed in Infinity War. We audiences felt the loss for him and emotionally resonnated when he (i) survived the planet blast and (ii) landed a critical hit on Thanos. Those were touching & high impact moments in Infinity War.
0:09 we meet again old friend...
Alright take care your grandma guys, she may be punched by captain marvel
1:30 when grandma calls the Xbox a gameboy
Who else saw this after someone told you it got realised and ran to your phone to see it?
I LOVE MARVEL  is just because of limiting super powers unlike DC UNIVERSE, But this is a shit....
yo its here holy shit
why she punch the old lady
Every 3rd shot is a slo-mo close up of her face.  If you don't have enough footage to show yet, hold off.
To everyone who's worried and baffled about the innocent poor old lady who got punched...
*punches old woman*
Give this movie to me this shit looks amazing
Looks uh really underwhelming. Ill hold my judgement for now but knowing that not only the comics suck this movie might too but well see
The Granny is probably a Skrull. They can change their appearance. I could even be one. (Gasp) Oh no, I have blown my cover!!!!
They had me at the out of context granny punch.
In the end she went all ‘Bring me Thanos’ mode but without stormbreaker. Something tells me she is more powerful than Thor, oh that’s right Kevin Fiege told us
This trailer is almost as entertaining as Ryan Reynolds's green lantern movie
I swear to god they better make her think that that old lady is a Skrull, but then it turns out she has just destroyed an old grandma's face
Not being sexist or racist here, however, you know this movie will get good ratings (same as bp) because there is a woman as the leader, instead for bp it was someone of different race to the ones told before.
Shit heros. Give us a hulk movie or iron man wtf
"Truth be told,I was ready to hang it up till I met you today."
Damn, that poor old lady...Lets get a RIP in the chat 🙏
Captain Marvel punches old lady
This trailer is interesting but not amazing, which I think is promising. Amazing trailers tend to give away every good part in an otherwise shitty film ie Suicide Squad
Just how many Elderly Females are going to get hit while riding the Bus? Marvel, not thinking things through, as usual. Some dolts believe this "STUFF".
superpunch 4 old lady ??????
Bruh why did she punch grandma?
Behold The Strongest Character in The MCU.
This Trailer doesnt have that old MCU Movie trailer feel to it that past movies had and IM ECSTATIC. This Really is the movie that will change the course of the MCU to Phase 4.
Holy shit blockbuster is still here? Next toysrus
Damn, Captain Marvel! 1:30 No need to punch an old lady for taking the last seat of the buss, I'm sure you can just fly.
so is everyone just going to ignore her slugging that old lady at 1:30 lol
1:36 holy shitttt😰😰😰😰😰😰
1:30 Did she just punch an old lady
When there's so many fake trailers you gotta scroll for a while to hit the real one
Skrull General: I've got it we'll disguise ourselves as Grandmas
how the hell you going to be Captain Marvel you punching  people grandmas and shit LoL
The only reason I would watch this is to see a young Nick Fury, otherwise it looks like shit 
Okay. First off this trailer looks bad. Second Brie Larsen is not the best Carol Danvers they could've cast. Third... They overlooked FOUR previous heroes to hold the title of Captain Marvel including a black woman and a lesbian woman while even having the brass plated balls to make Mar-vell a supporting character to his own legacy. 
Thanos must be shitting himself
When it says «In 2019». I feel old.
Damn, she hit poor sweet granny !!!!!
1:31 Rip thanos grandma
In 2019 , Discover , What makes , Her , A hero ... hit the old lady
*punches grandma*
This whole movie is going to be huge marvel universe spoiler, that’s why this trailer isn’t the impressive. They’re holding back a lot of stuff.
I just saw a superhero punch a grandma
Looks fun....but did she just punch a grandma? Really funny
50% of the comments (she punched grandma)
That grandma punch is right behind Will Ferrell punching a baby
Skrull General: Okay new orders do not disguise ourselves as Grandmas, we'll instead disguise ourselves as Orphans and Nuns.
OH SHIT DID I JUST SEE THE SKRULLS ?? If true, shit is gonna get real
I think Marvel saves the shitty footage for the teasers and drops the dope footage with the trailers... I’m seeing Black Panther parallels.
1:31 When ur grandma farts & acts like she didn’t
Bruh!!!!! She slapped granny😂😂😂😂😂
Lol she punched an old lady
Ronan, and captain marvel is punching a old woman, i need see that in my poor TV
How is it old ? Because you see a blockbuster 😂😂😂
Old Women: "NANI?!"
I guess there’s a story or Explanation behind why she Punch the Old lady 🤔
Look, I’m the biggest Marvel fan there is and I’m absolutely going to watch and enjoy the shit out of this movie no matter what, but who put this trailer together? It’s corny and feels rigid and fan made. Excited for the full trailer.
im not one who’s all for directors or producers pushing an agenda thru movies n films n all dat bullshit but as long as they’re not shoving it down our throats then im cool wit it. That seems to be the case here unlike some other films or games have done🤷🏻‍♂️.. and how y’all gon judge by trailers like what are y’all judging the action scenes? cuz i mean look at the glimpses of other scenes, that got me intersted to find out how it all pieces together aren’t y’all?.. Once again this is what they’re meant to do so if it fails either y’all just don’t pay attention to the details ooor...🤣🤷🏻‍♂️
1:31 😂 She just punched an old lady!
I just hope the old lady's name ain't   Martha😁
i laughed so bad when i saw hee punch the old lady
1:30 did she just punch an old woman?
This shit failed to impress me 😐 Why Marvel? Why???
1:30 when ur grandma tells u to eat 1 more plate after you have eaten 3 plates already
Thanos = *Hold my beer*
1:31 so she just did pounch that old lady.. good
He is 0 years old...
Yo the way she punched the grandma tho!!!😂😂😂
Eehhhh...  I'm a little underwhelmed?  Brie seemed a bit wooden if she didn't have her angry face on,  the music was a touch overpowering for the visuals,  and...  she clocks an old lady?!  WTF?!  Who's brilliant idea was it to put THAT in the trailer?
You know its old when theres an active blockbuster...
This looks shitty
Is it just me or she punched an old lady in the bus wtf
The grandma is thanos!!!!
That old lady got a good much.... lol🤣🤣
She punched granny 😂😂
Why does the MCU expect her to defeat Thanos when she barely damages an old lady with a punch???
For a teaser it definitely did that. It teased the shit out of me and I can't wait for the next one!
1:31 tf why did u punch her XD
I feel like that granny deserve what was coming 😏
Well this looks shit
When is this superhero nonsense going to end. It's the same damn shit over and over.
she punched an old woman WOW
1:31 when you're a Skrull shape shifted into an grandma
Omfg the old lady
Old lady got REKT!!
This girl graduated from my high school holy shit 😭😭
Awesome powers and now we have a old comic man who is Captain Marvel woman! :) in this trailer if that makes a difference.
Wow I think it's a old story of Nick fury..........
Grandma was probably a skrull or just a dick either way this looks a million times better than that boring Wonder Woman movie.
This is so e🅱️ic, can we hit grandma 😂👌🔥💯💯💕😍
Cool. Still not gonna spend a dollar on your movies until you fix your shit with Gunn.
We all are saying the movie will suck... don't you remember people said the same for Guardians of The Galaxy????  Well... it was a hit!!!! And also, NO MARVEL MOVIE EVER SUCKED
The trailer is okay but this is not a well known comic book hero like Thor and Iron Man so I think Marvel may need more as far as the trailers to really make this movie shine. Yes its the linchpin to the HUGE final Infinity War movie but the build up to that movie was literally 10 years in the making. Need a longer trailer with more backstory that puts an emphasis on Carol Danvers and who she is and how she relates to the everywomen in the world to take the movie from a big hit to a humongous hit like Black Panther, Ant Man and The Guardians IMO.
yo why tf she punch an old lady lmao
Super disappointing trailer.  And holy shit Brie can't seem to make any facial expressions...
Well I can't wait to see that grandma being punched on big screen, 3D is the best choice 😉😂
Obviously that old lady was not really an old lady? Like loki wasnt their dad..
Grandma provably looking like 👀 ik this bitch didn’t just punch me for sitting down  so what ima skrull
More generic capeshit...
she hit the granma . hahhahahahah 1:30
1:30 when you ask your grandma for Pokémon cards for your birthday, but when u unwrap it, it’s bakugan
If you know she don't care about punching the lady she won't care about Thanos
Marvel studios have made my movie viewing so bloody good these last few years. Every few months, another shit hot movie... Keep em coming marvel, I for one am having a great time! ✌️
Captain Marvel: *punches the shit outta old lady*
Old lady smiles *gets slapped* for no obvious reason
This old lady is a Skrull or she punch her because she is old?
She done hit an old lady 👵🏿
Spiderman- stoles shield from an old man.
This is some feminist shit right here, when is there going to be a male Superhero as the main character?
When Grandma doesn’t make enough cookies
Obviously if you know the comic's, lady must be a skrull. Skrulls shapeshift and if im not mistaken they will be the antagonists.  Cmon now yall can't believe that marvel would make a movie where a super hero punches an innocent old lady in her shit...
Her punching the old lady is symbolic of 3rd wave feminism finally killing off the traditional women. It's revealed the old lady said "My word! Your husband let's you wear that outfit in public young lady?" Just before Captain Marvel ends her life in a feminist rage.
1:31 Is that a Skrull in the form of Old lady "Carol Danvers" who has Shape Changing abilities?  That's why she punched that old lady I guess.
Old lady would have said DC is better than Marvel . 😈
Why is there so much hate wtf?? Oh Wait it’s the DC fans who are triggered that there Daddy Superman is gone and Shazam is gonna be a shit movie.
There was holy shit...
brie larson’s voice is super cringe. sounds like a 14 year old.
Punching old lady in the face - priceless
Hit like if you saw Jude Law in this trailer
Real heroes punch old ladies
Old lady got decked
Heyy that's my grandma!!!!
*punches a grandma*
You had me sold on this movie when she punched that old lady. Take note DC, this is how you build up interest. R.I.P DC Universe
She just punched an old lady in the face!
Hits old lady AbSoLute mAd LaD
Gonna be the same old "Super power person is strong then someone stronger comes and main character gets lucky". Bit over that tbh
On some real shit , this didn’t do anything for me at all .. looks boring , but the Kree/Skrulls look good.
Danvers knocks old lady's head off
I think the people in the comment section who are saying they aren't excited are the ones who don't know much about Captain Marvel. I don't think you're hyped because you don't know about Cpatain Marvel nor do you know her origin story. And don't comment this saying you do and you're just not getting hyped just cuz. Be honest you don't know shit about her it's okay. See if this was another Spidey film or Captain America you'd be excited cuz you KNOW those characters and it's fun to see them in different situations and how'd they handle it, cuz you've had the time to relate to them. But you see this is somebody not alot of people know about. But this is her origin this is gonna place the piece in the puzzle for infinity war. Cuz at the end before Nick Fury dies he sends a message out to her. We needed this movie. I'm excited and hyped because I have a soul. Lmao just kidding. But lighten up guys. This is what we needed. Be happy you're alive to see it.
1:30 i'm pretty sure she punches loki
old lady is probably a skrull btw
Wow, looks like...shit.
I think Marvel has been slacking off big time with CGI & Cinematography: Infinity War was mostly great but Black Panther had horrendous CGI & Homecoming and GOTG2 weren't that much better. Go watch the first Iron Man & Winter Soldier again to see how good an MCU movie can look...or Dr Strange to see how creative they can get.
Did I see captain marvel give an old woman a good slapping
RIP Granny Skrull....
The highlight of this trailer was her punching the old helpless woman👿😈
How many of you knows that the granny whom captain marvel slaps is thanos's mother. Vengence is sweeter with little violence😜😜😜
off why she hit a oldlady
I am pretty sure she hit the old grandma because she dared to smile.
So disappointed. Captain Marvel is an awesome character and this trailer did nothing but make her look like a boring overly-brooding grandma punching squeaky voiced brat.
Grandma don't feel so good
1:31 how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old woman?
*she hit the old lady man!!!!*
The old lady just kindly smiled and Captain Marvel punched her in the face!!
1:31 why did marvel punch a old lady ;;-;
damn she hit grandmama hard she went back to her 20's
I am the grandma puncher
at least she's white
Kind of a shitty trailer tbh. And it's cringey as well.
1.30 When granny replaced the cookie tin with her knitting set
Who died when she powers up and hit the old lady
She just punched the shit out of that old lady
lol that old grandma push xD
The old lady is her grandma and she hit her because she forgot Captin Marvels birthday...
*Old Lady:* *OOOOOOOOOF*
The reason she punched the old lady because she's a skrull
hit like if you think captain marvel crosses 1 billion?
MCU fans hit like
Although you just had to throw in an old lady getting punched in the face, didn't you?
I'm going just to see her punch an old lady in the face.
The old lady is DC, Carol be like “ok you can die with the rest of them”
So I'm not the only one to have negative and dull feelings after watching this shitty trailer. This trailer sucks
its going to be a shit movie
Angry commenters really deserve to be in the old lady's place.
Am I the only one who watched this out of curiosity after seeing the memes about the old lady?
Holy shit😮 I'm so hyped for this
Ok but she fine as hell wish I was tht grandma
When she punches the old women 😂
"Ohh that poor old lady!"
She hits an old lady probably because she's a Kree (they can morph)
Omg she hit old lady triggered
Cool, ive always wanted to see a superhero movie about a 40 year old woman playing a mildly annoyed, bored teenager.
Gonna see this movie opening day just so I can see the old lady scene
this trailer is shit
People the old lady was a Skrull
Hit like if u came before 2M views😎
did she just punch an old lady??? thats disgusting
why not on trending..... Agree then hit like button...
Mining old crap from a bygone era is lazy. Time to move on. Let's see something original for a change. Or have you no creativity left?
This looks great. I’m definitely looking forward to this. The music is really amazing too. I love a great heroic theme that swells in you that epic feeling of awe and heroism. On another note her punching that old lady made me laugh...( I know why she did) I should go hug my grandma to even things out.
My momma but white
I hate it when they force women into being superheros in live action movies. Comics are fine but the real shit is too corrny!
When she punched that old lady LMAOOOOOOOOOOO
Marvel You Have Another Hit On Your Hands
*punches old lady on the bus*
Lol why would you do that to a smiling old lady??
What happened to the good writers? Why does this look like cheezy shit?
Looks amazing! Cannot WAIT to see her smack the shit out of Thanos and wipe that smug look off his face
Trailer is boring. I just hope that the movie won't focus on the feministic bullshit. I hope they don't make her more powerful than anyone just because she's a woman and it's nice to give them an upper hand in power for once... I prefer reality. Unless the woman is a badass, like Wonder Woman. She is awesome.
Anyone else burst out laughing when captain marvel punched that old lady in the face lmao!! Bhaha
Who thought it was a good idea to have Captain Marvel knocking out an old lady with no context in the reveal trailer? Really makes me think, “wow, I wonder what other harmless creatures Captain Marvel will save us from”
i just wanna know why she hit the old lady. either she's bad, or carol is just really mean
They better explain why she punched the old lady
Whaaat?! Did she just KO an old lady?!? Haha
Frik the critics this shit gave  me cHilLs😰❄️* in italics + high pitch voice
not gonna lie looks pretty shit
1:30 could it be Stan Lee in disguise as a grandma?
Not going to lie this looks pretty shit
Hey watch this movie about a superhero beating the living shit out of innocent people
Damn she slap the f out of the old lady🤣
DC guys spotted doz who hit the dislike button😂
Why did you punch an old woman
Will she look older when she is in avengers 4 or look the same
I see comments that explain the old lady was a Skrull, but what if it wasn't 😂, lol what if Carol just hated the elderly?
Whats up with all the bullshit female lead roles. Im not buying it.
Here before views hit 500k hehe
Why’d she punch her grandma!?
Old lady: ,,No."
A superhero movie about why grandma should got punch.. 
Plot twist: the old lady is the real Aunt May
Well well, punching an old lady. Look how far we've come. I think the old lady deserved it.
y'all saw her smack that old lady right?
She punched an old lady 😂😂😂
Everything seems good though there is a need to whitewash this spotted some black people in it.
But why you gotta punch grandma tho?
you never know who your real enemy is " punches granma"
Any one noticed? Nick Fury Got 2 Eyes .. How old is this movie in the marvel universe? Older than Winter Soldier ? .. But When Nick Lost his eye he was a little bit young .. If this id before he lost his eye he looks the same as in infinity wars :(
*punches an old lady* “Make Her A Hero”

Old lady reminds me of that creepy old lady from that dennis quaid demon movie
Where are the fans realizing that if she hit the grandma its because she is a skrullz or scruls or wathever how it is spelled(excuse me for the broken english)
Grandma asked her to smile.
When grandma doesn't bake you any cookies
looks like shit mate
I think punching a 👵🏻 granny was an interesting clip to add in!!! I’m sure that lady was a skrull or something. Or she just pissed off Cap Marvel
Did she just hit a old lady?! Lol
Even thor never punch an old lady righ on the face XD
Real Shit just got made I’m confused what’s going on Marvel Studios and Captain Marvel daughter of Stan Lee?
*punches an old woman in the face*
Oh no Grandma!!! 1:30
Omg...grandma lol
Everyone complaining about how she doesn't smile needs to get punched like that Skrull.
Grandma’s getting slapped, now that’s interesting
My bet is that Thanos kills more people and says some sociopathic shit Hulk, Thor, and Iron Man, get freaky and some Blonde steps in finishing the Job then some other Super bad guy   is shown in end credits.
did she just punch that old lady in the face 
Hold on Thanos she is coming

I want to know why she punched the grandma!
Captain marvel just punched an old lady
Old lady probably Thanos 🤔🤔🤔😏😏😏
I see all these negative comments about the actor for captain marvel but I think punching an old woman and putting it on the trailer is a bad idea
1:30  when the old lady uses your seat on the bus
Even that old lady was a skrull she shouldn't suppose to hit her because she is superhero and that granny face she just can't hit her.. that could have look and feel so good
She better be hitting Thanos in the head the same way she did with that old lady!
i trust carol danvers so fuckin much i don’t even question her beating up that old lady. like she does it and i’m like “well maybe she deserved it”
Grandma: As you can see, ... ok I cant speak. My jaw broke.
Anyone else got goosebumps when she hit that Binary form?
Granny:DC 
*DAMN* people, this is gonna punch Shazam in the face
Typical white blond girl with superpowers. We need more black/latina/asian women as superheroes.
She could punch me in the face and I would thank her
"What makes her a hero" ... following by punching an old lady in the face.. lol savage
Supperub . Hit like or thumbs up if you all agree 😊
_When you had enough of grandma asking you if you had eaten yet_
*sees old lady getting socked*
I must say...putting the scene with punching a granny in the trailer makes me more interested to see the movie. 
That old lady was DCEU😂😂😂
A punch for a smile? Damn either she's having a bad day or that smile is the next challenge, 'Smile and get punch' challenge.
The writers for this film haven't written shit. And the shit they have written, is shit. Don't expect much of a story here.
Damn Can't wait for the movie, I bet it will be awesome. She fell from outer space and is not sure if she lived as a human or not. Then we saw a young Nick Fury who was ready to retire I guess but met Capt. Marvel. lastly she tried to punch an old lady which I think that the logical explanation is that the old lady is a skrull.
Ray Arnold (Jurassic Park played by Sam L.J.) left to go turn the power back on, being a coward after seeing the raptor fences out, ran to the nearest car and drove to the dock and saw a fishing boat. He loaded it up with fuel and sped off to the mainland.  Once on the mainland, embarrassed to be the cause of Robert Muldoon’s death.  He changed his name to nick fury and then met Captain marvel, loses eye (how?unknown) he then goes on to disetegrate.
Captain marvel:*hits grandma*
I'm sure there is an alien explanation of why the old lady Betsy was punched in the face haha!! The beginning of the first men in black taught us that aliens come in different genders and races lol
She gone beat the shit outta Thanos
1:29 That old woman is a Skrull?
The old lady can be a scroll
Punching old ladies...."I thought she was a skrull"

Her punching an old lady in the face sold me😂
She's punching an elder woman. I'm sold
The most action I saw was when she hit that old lady
She knocked out any teeth granny had left...
Was the old lady needed
She beat the shit out of that old lady
I feel like a lot of people are saying she’s not acting very well. Which is...weird because this doesn’t give her anywhere near enough time to display her acting chops. Cause. You know. It’s a trailer. I noticed they seem to be leaning heavily into a theme of her rediscovering her humanity and what we’ve seen of her being cold is probably from having her human memories erased. So this is a story of her recovering her humanity. Y’all need to calm down with the criticism of the movie.
She punched a grandma😂
Why is she puching  a old lady
*Poor Grandma..*
Captain Marvel's arch enemy has always been a grandma on a bus..fact
“A hero” *punches an old lady*.
Grandma:l have cupcakes 
her she attacked the old lady!!!!!
1:30 - Grandma made her a fat kid with chocolate chip cookies?  Or Skrull in disguise?  Place your bets!
if you guys pandering this show and use the shitty comic as the main story ill boycot the south east asian from this movie
Captain Marvel ne Grandma ko kyun mara ? (Only Indians and Bahubali fans will get it) 😂😂😜😜
Why did she hit grandma
She punched the old woman in the face probably because it was a SCRULL
That old lady must have told her to smile more
Captain Marvel: punching old women since 1994
Lame. More garbage university brainwashed feminists can live vicariously through, until a desire for another cat hits them 2 months later. Then they need another band tattoo to hide their pain.
I hate that Skrulls can look like old ladies. Something so sinister can be someone so sweet
What makes her strong,she punches old lady???😂😂😂
1:30 When you see all grandma jokes
1:31 im sorry im a terrible person for laughing, but seriously, the old lady just smiles being all friendly then all of a sudden cap is just like POW NO
1:31 Did she just make a grandma clock out?
I think captain marvel is older than the avengers, but cap America still older. Because nick fury still have the hair and the old agent of shield(that were still alive) still have his full hair
punches old woman in the face
1:32 Was that lady a Skrull? I heard those shapeshifters would appear in the movie, giving Marvel a motive to punch her.
Finally an official trailer. Was sick watching all those fan made billshit.
That granny was some evil alien in disguise or something right lol?
So everybody is here saying trailer is bad it is gonna be a huge flop blablahblah...just after seeing first trailer.seriously...if you think trailer help. ...To judge a movie either it is  bad or good then my friend you are wrong coz justice league trailer was lit but as all we know the movie was shit😂so my friend take a chill pill and wait for next trailer😎
They done messed this up before it even came out with casting this cherubic white girl. I want to the classic Ms. Marvel with the tight one-suit black/dark blue bikini and mask. Now that was sexy! I'm all about a hot chick who also kicks ass, not this namby namby millenial MeToo crap these days. This Brie Larson chick be like that one sorority girl who's trying too hard to fit the part with all the hot chicks in da house!
Has anyone seen a superhero punch an old lady 👵

Why she punched the old lady?? Wtf.. 😐
Grandma:No you can't have a candy bar
At 1:30, did she just randomly punch an old friendly grandma who smiled at her on the train?
Man, it has cool visuals but with all due respect... The only exciting moments were watching old Sam l and Jude Law. I am honestly hoping the next trailer does not make this look like a Thor the dark World kind of movie.... quite boring.
Are we just going to ignore the fact that Captain Marvel punched the jeepers out of my grandma...
It doesn’t matter anymore as long as the lead is a woman and the movies shit is all that counts thesedays
Şehitl ❤ 
*Immediately punches old lady in the face* 
But why punch the old lady though?
Any time a movie comes out in March it's gonna blow chunks . I've yet to see a movie released in my birth month that was worth while. This shit better prove me wrong.
Why'd you hit my grandma like that :(
Lost all my hype for this movie in less than a minute, looks trash, but if Marvel can surprise me then okay but I ain't holding my breath.
1:30 loki as grandma😂😂
If thanos’ snap didn’t kill your grandma well then captain marvel will

Oh wait there was a space movie I think Ryan Reynolds. Oh yea Deadpool killed that timeline so my comment still stands
It was good to see you again Blockbuster, my old friend.
Did she just smack a grandma?
Listen Wonder Women is cool but did she hit a grandma? I DONT THINK SO
I don't want one more super powerful hero added to the team as the answer to beating Thanos, I want the old team to come together, get their shit together, and try new strategies to beat him and actually struggle against him.
1:31 _When your grandma told you she liked BvS_
she ain’t no hero she punched an innocent old lady😂
Can you imagine if grandma isn’t a skrull.
lmfao the grandma
Its a movie, stop being nerdy and enjoy. It looks good and will be, like all the other Marvel Movies. It is the Marvel Universe but this is the movie. Stop comparing things its irritating and irrelevant. Just enjoy the movie. Thanks!!! P.S  Common since would tell you theirs a twist behind the lady being old. Do you think its really an old lady (think) oh yea my bad. Everybody is a comedian these days.
Smacked back to the Old Republic that grandmother was.
Superman : Hold my beer
that old lady is skrull👾
Well to be perfectly honest, i'd also want the right to punch senior citizens who act entitled and rude just cause of the fact that they are old.
If you can save the planet by hitting grannies.....i am gonna hit grannies first!
1:30 Thanos's granny.
I couldn't stop laughing when she punched the granny

It is ironic how the grandma skrull punching never gets old.
Did she just punch an old lady? That's kinda messed up. Fingers crossed she's actually an evil mutant or alien or something
Captain marvel: get punched grandma!
Watching It with My Grandma 😅 that was rude .
So what is this, Marvel didn't have enough imagination to create a new FEMALE hero so they had to pull out an old one and make HIM a woman? Why can't you guys leave the comic characters the way they were written and make new ones if you don't have enough women or minorities. What next? A Black Lesbian Female Thor?
1:31 grandmas have left the chat
When the most memorable moment in the trailer is when the main character punches an old lady, it’s not leaving me with high hopes.
She's no hero! She punched an old lady at 01.30
Actually the trailer isnt so appealing, but i still hit like button bcs this movie will be related to the next avengers
*looks like a DC shitfest to be honest*
The old lady skrull punch was neat.

In a world where green lantern will always suck, one young air force captain must seek out your grandma.... and punch her in the face !! 
Katheryn Winnick, Margot Robbie or any other white woman who looks like one of these two or even at LEAST look like Captain Marvel in the comics would've suited better for this movie.
Chill guys the old lady was a shape shifter
Why would captain marvel punch a old lady

Thanos is tranformed into an old woman guys don't worry.
1 like = 1 pray for old lady
She looks like a white suburban  Mom in a cos play costume LMFAO
Thor fans hit the like button.
I'm just saying, there's been a lot of Toon Blast Ryan Reynolds' has been popping out of every Avengers leaked crap from every YT crack. Seems like he's waiting on something.
Holy shit! Only 31M views and it's already the 4th most like movie trailer of all-time 👍👍👍👍👍
Marvel: Will come out with a (so far) lame alteration of Captain Marvel that's literally an older "supergirl" in different clothes.
10/10 will beat the old lady again
was gonna make a granny beater joke but scrolls down and realises how unoriginal I am
Gonna be sure shot hit
Poor grandma :/
So excited to watch this!!! Oh shit!!!!
The blockbuster got me dead , that’s how you know it’s suppose to be old
I feel bad for the grandma in that scene I mean it is probably a skrull by still the actor
Why Captain Marvel just rock that old ladies shit lmaoooo
I like it when they slapped the old lady
Looks like granny didn't give Captain Marvel all of the cookies she wanted.
Ohh shittttt thisss is dopeee
Hit like if you too want it on trending #1 over the globe😍😎😎😎
C'mon guys we all know grandma is a shape shifting alien, if you watched the cartoons or read the comics you know thats a Skrull 😒
The old lady who she hits is kraken right
1:31 when ya grandma says she aint cooking the turkey this thanksgiving
Punching an old lady is a thing now
1:31 I thought we weren't supposed to hit the elderly
But overall I'm Excited for this shit.
Did she really just punch an old woman in the face.
Superhero already told you next year 2019 beat hit captain marvel
aww damn did she just punch a old lady
That old lady punch was horrible. It was like she closed fist smacked her instead of an actual punch. 0/10 will not watch.
Old Lady : Shazam is The Orignal Captain  Marvel
When you’re on the bus and a granny asks you to let her take your seat
Before trailer hits million views😃
Controversial? Punches old lady, she seems so lame this is going to be a flop
and then there's me, punching random old ladies in the face and not opening doors for them.
1:30  "So apparently no hitting girls applies to the elderly too" -Dylan
next shit movie
1:31 When Grandma buena the cookies...
If that’s the only scene where Brie Larson punches an old lady I’m not even going to bother watching the movie
Btw the old lady is a skull
Not seeing this because her metoo bullshit twitter post
y'all who say the casting isn't good or that brie can't act: 1) she has an oscar so she's already acting a ton better than y'alls faves, 2) how did you expect her to act when she's just walking? what kinda emotional expression should she have??? especially when it seems like she's lost her memories?? it's only the first trailer and you guys are judging based on that. you only care about pitting her against wonder woman or any other mcu film. the least you could do was keep your judgment on hold for when the actual movie comes out because judging based on a two minute trailer that's meant to not reveal much and only give us the first look of the character is extremely pathetic. get a job.
Old lady=skrull
Idk, this is one of the most boring trailers I have seen,apart from punching that grandma 😂. Totally unimpressed. But Im sure Marvel won't disappoint. Hopefully.
Blockbuster what old thing blockbuster
That shot of her punching a grandma is gonna be meme, calling it now
The old lady is probably a shapeshifting Skrull. Anyone who had read the CM comics would know that the Skrull are a key part of the comics. So yeah. You can all put down your pitchforks now.
now I know who hit my granma
I am very much positive that Marvel was intentionally holding a lot back here with this trailer. It was an 'off' season to launch a trailer, especially when movie going slightly takes a back seat. When thanksgiving arrives, shortly followed by Holiday season, that's when they are going to release the best of the bunch. Having said all that, this trailer personally for me served it's purpose and kept my expectation right where it was supposed to be at this moment. A very solid first sell, if not the 'best'. BEST yet to come. Trust Marvel.👍
1:30 straight merked that old nanny
The Shit Is Real.....
Also, old lady is probably a skrull in disguise.
this looks like some shit made in imovie. i’m excited for this movie though. i hope it lives up to our expectations.
She probably heard the old lady saying "shazam was better"
Brie Larson hates white men, so I won't go see it.
The old lady must be a skull lol 1:31
At first i was like " this gon be meh at be..." *Sam jackson appears* shit fam this gon be amaizing
What! Why would she punch that old lady!
1:31 When granny refuses to give more cookies xD
lol..yall know she isnt really a grandma right???
When your Grandma offers you food even though you just ate
But most importantly she give the old woman a slapp
Who hit the download and like before playing it?
That's messed up how she would hit a grandma like that
Tha fuq would they show an image of her punching grandma without context lol?
The grandma punch is gonna be a new meme
miss casting...she doesnt looks like a hero. Just like a crier single mom. Shit
To those complaining, the lady she punched is Super Skrull.
Damn poor grandma got knock the f out 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why did she punch an old lady?
It was my grandma
Is no one going to address the fact that she clocked an old lady
Carol Danvers thought that old lady was a Skrull, but is she really?!
What if it comes out that Danvers punching what she thought is a shapeshifting skrull ended up being an actual grandma instead?
She smack fire out that old lady lol Haha the old lady must be in disguise as the enemy that's why she got popped liked that
I’m going to take an educated guess that grandma who she punches is in fact a shape-shifting SKRULL also pretty big of a plot hole she wasn’t even mentioned as part of the avengers initiative...hmph.
Looks like a better looking non cringey shitty acting CW Superwoman.
Im I the only one who saw her punch a old lady!
If you wanted the old lady to get out of the seat, you could've asked, not punched her
@_@ poor old lady @ 1:31
Oh goody, another plain white superhero. Just what we all wanted 🙄
The good old Blockbuster. The 90s were so cool man.
When she punched the fuckin old lady
Holy Shit. Don’t know if I’m more hyped about the trailer or seeing Blockbuster.
*I come here every day to check the new grandma comments. It’s part of my routine now*
YEAH punch that old lady
Secret Invasion Grandma for the win. Next we must have cows!
Super heroes shit! I wish they stop these movies.
Why does the CGI have to look like shit
The old lady is a skrull so calm down
Is everybody just gonna ignore the fact that she just smacked the shit out of a grandma
Ohshitdawgtisgud
1:31 when your grandma beats you at B.I.N.G.O
She hit the old lady because it’s a skrull. Skrulls hide in plain site by shape shifting into people.
(Punches old lady)
You hit my grandma!
Grandma: Hello my dear.
You can't call yourself a Marvel fan if you ask " Why she punched an old lady?"
Tired of this super hero shit
Yeah, I'll pass on this shit.
So the old lady 👵🏾 must have been some dark alien lord for her to punch her....if not.....well then.....:
1:30 when you're already full but grandma still wants you to eat.
To a point where I feel Arnold Schwarzenegger would be a better fit, in terms of being in a emotionless role.
Marvels fans hit like
Seriously marvel, having your main character in the movie punch her grandmother, shame on you, shame on you.
Grandma can take a punch
You know who else I think is a Skrull? The woman who told Tony about Charles Spencer in civil war. Cuz she got a bigger role in MCU as Black Mariah in Luke Cage. The police officer  in The Avengers final battle scene. Cuz he got a bigger role on Agent Carter. The army officer in The Incredible Hulk. Cuz he got a bigger role of Remorath leader in Agents of SHIELD season 5
ummmm...she hit an old lady right? bad girl
Impressive, she punched that old lady because it appeared it was a Skrull.
I don’t give a f**k about your grandma 
I just wanna put this out there that this takes place in the 1970s to like the 1990s so will she be old in avengers 4?
N***** Imma f***ing punch your grandma.
Dis sumh nice shit i see here
why did you have to  hit grandma? hehe
She just punched a old lady!!!!!??????
You had me at punching an old lady in the face.
My face when she hit the old lady:  😱
More PC bullshit. Hollywood has lost me forever
oh god the granny memes are on the way now
Pretty excited for the future marvel movies holds.
Did she just punched an old lady in the face ?
grandma has left the chat
Why she hit that old lady
LMFAO WHAT. Did she just punch an old lady 1:31
Hitting the old Kree lady in the face sold it for me XD
Did I just witness captain marvel punch the shit out of some kind old lady at 1:31
Captain Marvel- I am Carol Danvers and I knocked out a grandma on a Subway
That old lady ain't a old lady
     Punching an old lady
When the world created by Marvel is so f*cked that they have to throw themselves in it to set it straight... and the first thing they do is punch old ladies.
that's perry white
Side note: why did she punch an old lady? 😂
Thanos Car vs Grandma Car, who will win?
Already a bigger hit than DCs Justice league haha
Finally This trailer tells me Marvel has a Strongest and Powerful Superhero like supergirl or superman.. Hit like if u agree💯
she s punch my grandmam...
I need a gif of her punching that grandma asap..
Did she just deck a smiling grandma? Maybe not the best thing to include in a first trailer for those unfamiliar with the comics, because it’s unintentionally hilarious.
The old woman scene does put a smile on my face
Did she just punch Martha ??
Ooooh yeah, thanos should fear a grandma hitting super hero
Scared of the Whiteman films.
I would rather watch suicide squad trailer thrice over this shit. Disappointed.
That granny punch on the bus... I feel like non comic book fans r gonna b like “wtf?” Even More than I was. N I kno what skrulls r ha
1:31 RIP Granny 
petition not to remove the helmet.that helmet is so f*cking awesome!! f*ck them if they throw it away or used it only in one scene! she's so epic with that helmet! one thing i dislike is the effect in her fist on the train scene.. it quite thin than i expected... it looks like a laser beam than shooting a burst of fire.. hope they could make it a little bit thick and golden.
1:31 Lmao! She punches an old lady. I'm guessing thats Skrull disguised as an old lady but why even show that in the trailer. Thats just unintentional comedy. XD
For those of u saying she hit skrull in form of grandmother.... U have to be right otherwise a legal notice on carol will hit her home (if there is one) and a curse even adam wont even save her ass
Old lady Skrull rocked in the face FTW
marvel is on some next level shit.
I am not sure whether she broke Grandma's teeth but she definitely broke the internet
They got black people to come out in droves for black panther... they now want women to do the same. Smh This shit look wack af
*Plot twist: The grandma is Thanos grandmother*
Except for the old lady scene. That was more like 'lol wtf? 😆'
jEEZ i cant wait,,, sure the trailer is kinda cliche but mAN im gonna watch the shit out of that movie,,, im so excited!!!
You can tell they're going to play the "I am woman, hear me roar" angle by the "little girl, older girl, young woman, kick ass full grown woman superhero" montage at 1:41. Which might not be bad.... but you know how lazy studios get with this shit, they think that's enough to carry the whole movie.
She punched the grandma because she’s probably an alien in disguise
When Grandma gives your sibling more food
The poor grandma smh. Kids these days...
Old lady: ouch wtf!
*No Grandmas were harmed in the making of this video*
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo shit I m so excited
This movie old asf, There’s a god damn blockbuster.
Dc fans be like I'm gonna hit that dislike button even if i like it.
Plot twist: the old lady is Mystique
Captain marvel slapped a grandma
I fell in love with this trailer when she punched the old lady
Looks like shit to me
That old lady she punched is a shape shifting alien called a skrull.
Holy shit!!!!! This looks fuckin awesome 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍♥️♥️♥️♥️ Brie Larson is lit af 💥💥💥💥💥💣💣💣
why did she punched an old lady?
If anybody's interested in talking about anything besides the granny-slap or the actresses expression, hit me up.
Shity woman super hero... End of the world
When Capt Rogers has slept for over a decade. She took his place for helping people not just a simple war with guns but some shit aliens trying to invade planet. Capt Marvel for yah, bi'atches! 😉
Not sure I can say much about this other than same old, same old (apart from punching an old woman - that's new and about the only interesting thing in the trailer). Not blown away by this and not bothered one way or another about seeing it but then again I've been like that about all the Marvel films apart from Infinity war and Deadpool.
Did you look at that punch ? 😂
This looks awful , i was most excited at the grandma getting a hook to the jaw than the rest of the trailer
Damn! Captain Marvel just straight up cold-cocked an old lady!
I know that's probably an alien in disguise, but the hero punching an old lady probably isn't the best way to introduce people to her.
1:30 when granny doesn’t give you cookies
old lady: *doesn't say thank you*
Shit comments everywhere.
1:30 so nobody is going to alk about her punching a old lady😂😂
Avengers 4:- hold my beer....
Why grandma attack?
P.S.: This is an opinion, plz don't hire a hitman to end me, thank you :)
pure horse shit
A female hitting a female?! This is so wrong, women should only hit men! That it’s the meaning of equality.
Why did they have to do the old granny like that lol
Looks shit mate
*IRON MAN FANS Hit like plzzz*
I'm glad I was already in the can when I hit play. Otherwise it would've been hard to explain to a crowded Denny's how a grown man just shits himself. That Blockbuster throwback tho
ahh that white holes XD
Why does she slap the old lady...????
This movie is shit.
1like=1punch
She Smacc Grandma
Not really hyped for this shit but ok
Truth be told, I wanted the heros I've been loving from years (Tony Stark, Cap, Thor...) to take down Thanos together. They're the reason I watch Marvel movies.
The best part of the trailer was when she punched the old lady tbh
she punched a granny
Most people will watch the movie to find why did she hit the old women 🤔🤔
Ok I'm sold mfkrs!!!
grandma on the phone
Can I get a RIP for grandma?
All I know is that she better not shit on Thanos in Avengers 4
The grandmother is a Skrull shapeshifter. This is going to focus on the Kree/Skrull war most likely. THAT'S why she punched the grandma. Since so many people keep pointing that out.
Captain Marvel *punch*
I've seen other channels put up this trailer and I thought this shit was clickbait, but when I saw it from marvel studios... Dis shit IS REAL!!!
awesome grandma punchin
Did she just an old woman?!?! (yes I know that old woman might be a skrull)
It's all fun and games till you deck an old lady
Okay marvel very fuckin ballsy having her punch a grandma with no context in a trailer right after the “a hero” graphic goes by
that old  lady a skrull
look at the like to dislike ratio. People who are actually interested in the film dont leave a comment, they like and go on with their lives. The twats who dont know what they are talking about feel the need to tell everyone. "shes emotionless, worst marvel trailer, Blockbuster blah blah blah." all these comments will mean abosulte shit when the film comes out.
Oh yay another white marvel super hero..🤔😑
1:30 when grandma give your Mac and cheese without the Star Wars noodles, like you asked.
Old Woman: Donald Trump isn’t actually *that* bad!
imagine if it was stan she punched LOL 😜😂
Grandma was stan Lee's girl
@ 1:30 when you find out your grandma ate all the pizza rolls
*gets punched by captain marvel
ok, I'm sold 
punched an elderly woman for no reason
*Lemme just write a comment about the grandma and pretend i'm unique and special*
Lol did I just shit my pants?
I think old lady is peter grandma from spiderman, oh poor lady get purple lump on eyes
**punches elder** 
Hit a like for Nick & Brie ❤️
- Old lady who got hit
A little bit disappointed of the trailer ! I don't know why it is quite weird seeing Captain Marvel punching an old woman (obviously a skrull ) Hope the movie will be better !! 😁😁
White male fragility is coming.
Just punches an old lady. Casually.
Punching a old lady in the face :)
Wow.hit like here who are eagarly waiting for it.😍😍😍
Grandma is the key to all this.
...Blockbuster hit.
Because punching grannies is always a crowd pleaser? At least it's realistic for what an average woman can deafeat in combat.
Captain Marvel: Punch bunch old gentle Lady I guess?
When grandma is an old Fox news watching racist b****.
Granny: * dead * x_x
-she hits an old woman-
people really commenting about her not smiling, punching an old lady and this trailer being boring
lol I hope the grandma punch scene will become a meme
The old lady is probably a skrull.
Wow Captain Marvel you truly are a hero for slapping a old lady, yep my new favorite super hero now😂
The old lady might be one of the skrulls...
Could have at least shown the Skrulls shapeshifting so it would make sense why she would punch a old lady
Old lady was probably an alien. Probably to lead up to secret wars.
Sal from Impractical Jokers "Shut your face, Grandma!"
Punch a grand ma that is wrong
Half these comments are about her punching an old lady in the face lmao
She is going supernova shit great
So the old lady is a skrull?
Oh shit, this shit lit
We all gonna ignore she decked an old lady?
Did she punch an old lady? damn
Look all of the 13 year olds incoming
I have a feeling that  grandma is a skrull in disguise. Why else would captain marvel punch an old lady.
She punched the f'ing grandma! She has NO chill
So we gonna act like marvel didn't punch 👊the old lady right? 👀✌
Aye who's here before it hits the trending page?
Captain Marvel : *hits an old lady*
Old Spice Is Behind Captain Marvel’s Hair
Pretty sure at least half of everybody felt bad for the old lady getting hit in the face on 1:30
*Hit like if you think thor is more powerful than captain marvel*
What?!she punched a old lady with that power..captain Marvel is not the strongest avengers she just hired an innocent..doctor strange and scarlet witch is powerful than captainmarvel
Omg she knocked that old lady out 
1:30 shame on you, you hit poor old grandma Tilda,
This looks okay... but holy shit, they really made Samuel L. Jackson look just like he did in Die Hard With a Vengeance
Grandma said water isnt wet
It's a good trailer,..but it became disturbing when she punch the grandma WTF...even it's obviously a villian...I still found it uncool
DAAAMN Captain  Marvel punching old Grannies in the face now lmao
Grandma: shazam is the real captain marvel
Did Captain Marvel throw hands with an old lady?
I felt bad for the old lady
What a lame trailer of Captain Marvel! It seems Marvel still do not have what it takes to make an entertaining over-powered superhero. Even with such charming Hemsworth, the first 2 movies sucked and they had to make a comedy movie instead of a superhero movie to finally give him a big break in the MCU. And they still do not have any guts to go for a character like Hulk. They've stopped taking risks and are doing okay with superheroes who are more like spies than actual superheroes, which explains how MCU's best movie till date is Winter Soldier, which is more of an SPY, SCI-FI movie rather than a Superhero movie. 
A hero who dont had fear to punch  grandmas and when the  earth is in danger, she will not appear to save the day(at least if the half of the universe died)
Old lady got recked lol
Underwhelming, cold acting just like Tomb Raider actress. Is that new trend in Hollywood or something? Hiring young boring actresses?
The amount of people saying ok she punched an old lady is ridiculous like obviously it’s a skrull
We're just gonna pretend she didn't deck a smiling old lady in the face there
3 things,. 1. Can y'all stop calling her wonder woman and comparing this to wonder woman, 2. The old lady captain marvel hit was a skrull, so y'all can stop tripping about it,  3. Y'all complaining and hating on trailer, ain't seen the movie, and already judging it,  smh,
Did no body see her sucker punching that old lady at 1:30.... no?..... no?
Vikram Prabu Fans hit like😍
How funny if the old lady ACTUALLY isn’t a scroll but Captain Marvel thinks she is! 😂🤣😂
Ok Marvel is amazing somehow they made samuel l jackson super old and actually make it clean
Looks at a old lady
the cinematography is pure gold
1:30 aunt May got punched in the face.
Strong female lead punches old lady in the face.
Brie Larson's acting looks absolutely horrid, that punch she threw looks so FRAUDULENT. Either Captain Marvel doesn't know how to fight or Brie Larson was miscast.
maybe there's a second trailer, just to explain why the old woman punches
Commence the memes of Captain Marvel giving an old lady a mean right hook
Its the beginning of the untold story again. This movie will be the next hit blackbuster and Top grossing film..
Şehitl❤ 
Marvel Civil War 2 ruined captain marvel for me truth be told, the fact that in the comics she kiss the government's ass doesnt help either lol, and in MCW 2 too me she was some batman shit when she said,"even if theirs a .1% chance" (That Blank happens) with the dude see a potential future......... trailer looks good tho
Me : i guess punching smilling old lady is considered a heroic action..
Holy shit! 😂
When Grandma Don't give you Cookies 1:30
why tho i feel like ,,Captain marvel punching a smilling granma" is gonna become a meme?
Damn what did grandma do?😂
YESSSS Old people are the biggest threats out there
So you like kicking butts do ya? Well we'll show you old woman!
Tbh that old lady had it coming
Why she old grammy
She punched a old lady that’s fcked up
This must be a trailer for the real trailer. If not, I’m smacking grandmah.
yo but we just gonna ignore the fact that Cap clocks an old lady at 1:30 ?
Grannys a skrull
Brie Larson looks like she's always smelling shit.
Shit she's like the Phoenix from X-Men.
The special effects are going to be flashy and over done in order to compensate for the vanilla storyline driving the movie. The typical " only you can save us" shit. 
So we’re just not gonna talk about the fact that she punched an old lady in the face
MARVEL : Hold my beer
This is so shit I don't mean to be sexist but if CAPTAIN MARVEL IS WOMAN I'M NO LONGER A FAN it's so boring when a female is the lead sorry if I offend you I don't intend to but I can't stand it
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me that it's actually a regular old lady she's punching and not a knee/villain. That would be amazingly hilarious!
not bad, not bad, not shit but not as hype and great as the others.
Dude she punched an old lady for no reason!
Only seeing the movie to see why the poor old lady got punched lol
"Old Lady, I want your bag!"
Grandma- "Well, hi there young lady."
This IS NOT a movie about a super hero....this yet another attempt to indoctrinate the world into desping white men. THATS IT
Is no one gonna point out that Captain Marvel just punched an old woman?
Shiiiiiiiiiit, that poor old gal...
1:30 when my grandma bakes cookies with RAISINS instead of CHOCOLATE CHIPS
These days, all i see is criticism everywhere. Movie too dark, Trailer too boring, Character not too good..  What happened to the old days where we just wait for the movie and enjoy it. Ugh this generation!
Reporting for old lady abuse
That Grandma is not A human....
Did she just slap someone’s grandma
*Punches an old woman*
The most basic white chick they could find
*shows her punching a random grandma*
dear marvel studio,please don't kill the old hero in avenger 4
Why did she punch the old woman my heart broke when she do it 💔
did she slap a granny?
I am going to see this movie for the sole reason that I want to see Captain Marvel punch an old woman in the face.
I still like the old cap🔻
Yeah... I'm gonna' need a little more explanation to that old lady punch there.
1:31 Calm down, the old lady was a skrull
She punches grandmas GET YOUR GANDMAS OUT OF HERE!!
Grandma is probably like a skrull or something
my old job: Blockbuster video lol
Not completely sold ... but 1:35 looks perfect
And whoever dislikes this movie will be deemed a white privaleged neo nazi mysoginist kkk member yayyyyyyyyyy
So old ladies are a threat huh?
Am I the only one here who thinks she sounds like Triss Merigold?
Lemme guess, it’s probably going to have a male antagonist, which makes it an automatic 100% rotten tomatoes, critically acclaimed, award winning movie solely on that fact of women’s rights. (Cough cough, Wonder Woman) But oh boy, if the roles were reversed, it would be kicked in the trash for misogyny. Same thing if it was a white protagonist against a black one (bad), black defeating someone white, give em an Oscar. People nowadays are preaching equal rights and anti-racism but overlook that same atrocities happening on the opposite of their narrow minded agenda.
Okay i already figure it out, she punched that damm face of OLD lady which makes her strongest superhero in MCU 😂😂😂
Thanos better watch out for this one. She punched a someone's grandmother in the face.
1:33 is that Arnold Schwarzenegger?
punching grandma is gonna be new meme
Old lady is a skrull!!
Looks like shit 💤
wakanda shit is this
Holy shit!
She really punched that poor grandma ...? 
well this is complete shit just as expected
That lady looks like just an ordinary old lady LMAO watch her get arrested
I think Captain Marvel thinks that old lady is a skrull so she punch that old lady in 1:31 for that.
Remix her punching an old lady ha lol
Why did the grandma get fuckin smacked
She punched a old lady?😱
To those dissing this Trailer... Please may I remind you that this is Captain Marvels FIRST trailer, there's still going to be 2 or 3 more Trailer releases before the Movie hits Theatres lol
Sees on old lady get KO... Buys ticket for Captain Marvel. Lmao
Is she that criminal going around punching grandmas that Caleb City keeps talking about
I swear if Avengers 4 is just her coming and saving all the Avengers from Thanos it’s going to be the shittest movie out here because imagine have 3 Avengers movies iron man having 3 solo movies and captain America having 3 and Thor having 3, 12 movies just so some overrated unknown hero with one movie can come and save all their asses if that’s the case just let Thanos win
A hero is someone who can hit an old woman...
For those of you who don't understand the punching of the old lady, The Skrulls and some of The Kree (Ruul) have the ability to shape shift at will and adapt to whatever the environment requires (flight, breathing underwater, etc.).  So there.... my helpful "Nerdly Deed of the Day" is complete.
Also poor old lady
1:30 When you want to charge your phone but your grandma's life support is taking up the only outlet
I want to see her punch the granny at the theater so I can bust out laughing inappropriately
Who thinks it looks like shit
Skrulls are coming to MCU! They will change everything....they will also will make their appearance in Avengers 4....  Old lady was punched in the face because she is a god dam skrull :D
i am waiting for thanos to punch her face...hahaha...poor captain marvel...
Man wow she punched an old lady lmfao really people it's not an actual old lady read the comics!
She really did just punch an old lady.
Slaps a old lady
Everyone keeps commenting on the old lady punch clip. Do none of you read up on the movie details? The Skrulls are shape shifter aliens who are invading Earth. It's not an old lady.
She punched the shit out of thst old lady
Grandma was actually,
Captain Marvel on grandma burning the cookies:
Yeah, punch that old lady skrull
that old lady brie hit must be thanos disguised with help of his infinity stones
Do not make this a feminist shit show.
What makes her a hero, punching a grandma across the face
Could be a sleeper hit
she puched granny(skrull
Just going to punch an old lady-Captian Marvel
i got surprised when she hit the grandma. XD
Thanos is like I am not grandma leave me. 😂😂
I hope the entire movie just has a constant crescendo as a soundtrack. Just two hours of super loud orchestra hits with no context.
*The real* Captain Marvel trailer is way better than this grandma punching girl
Punching a smiling grandma
I never seen a heroe punching a old lady because she smile at her😆
Only Thor fan hit liks
It's gonna be really awkward for those not understanding why she just punched an old lady in the jaw.
OOF Granny gone
The comment section is all about the granny LOL
Captain Marvel punching an old lady that doesn't seem like a hero to me!?
Argh such a shitty trailer. Marvel, I wasn't expecting this. Come on, do a better job! Also, the special effects in this movie seem way too off... too old fashioned? Like, the 90s were not the 60s, just saying.
Super duper hits
Dislike for slapping grandma
Did she just punch an old lady 😱
So we're just gonna ignore the fact she punched an old lady 1:30.😱
Damn she punched an old lady!
I spit my food out when she puched the old lady lmaooo
Looks bland. She just seems to show the same emotion for everything. Will probably still see it. But first trailer is pretty shit so far.
This is really, really average. I hope the next one is better, because my money still wants to stay in my bank account. I know the shill media will hype the shit out of this and push identity politics into it all, but I hope Marvel just has a movie about a good character that is written well.
Did I just see captain marvel punch an old lady, is this Disney's "kill the past" mantra on steroids?
1:31 when grandma goes through your search history
So she just gon' punch an old lady like that
Why is she punching old ladies, as if we weren't in deep with elderly neglect and abuse. 😐
P.S. part where she punches an old lady, sorry, but that is iconic!!!!
I know everyone is saying the grandma is a Skrull, but I would be kind of salty the Fantastic Four where never able to be the ones to bring them to the silver screen (since the Skrulls were first introduced with the FF) after Marvel acquires them. Anyhow, this looks like a fun time, wonder if Mar-Vell is the dude in the similar suit as Carol.
Rip grandma, rip Saturday cookies
*Captain marvel punches an old lady*
I can’t wait for this overpowered feminist wet dream to ruin infinity war part 2, why would they leave all of the original avengers cast alive at the end of part one, sending a strong message thematically, if they are just gunna add this bitch and use her as the ultimate plot device. This movie is going to be shit first of all, just like ant man and the wasp was shit, I just pray to sweet merciful Buddha that her shit doesn’t drag into part 2.
Okay let’s put all the old lady jokes aside, this trailer is pretty bland and underwhelming. I’m setting hopes low on this one.
A here that punches old laides 3:31
Whahaha that moment, when grandma smiles to you, and you give her a big smack on dat face🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So she punched an old lady
Did she really punch that old lady?
Hold on guys, 1:32, isn't that Ronan the Accuser??
And that the villain of this movie is either an old woman or Captain Marvel
Holy Shit!!! Another bad year for DC!!!!!!!!!
2.0 fans hit like
why she punching old people!?!?
that poor old lady
Kinda looks like shit
I mean she punched an old lady!! I needed Cookies!!!
She hit an old lady mmmm... 
Why did she do dat. She punched a old lady
Captain Marvel said “I’ll sock ol’ grandma on the face!”
Shit i totally underestimated this, i need more, MORE TRAILERS!!
Why did she punch grandma?!
stayed for punching grandma FeelsGoodMan
This movie belongs on the Disney channel .. looks like shit
Yo she bugged she knocked granny😂
Seems like a piece of shit feministic movie
1:31 granny has stolen the trailer
Marvel is spreading their shit thin
best scene in the end bout i want to know wtf she was doing with that grandma
The Grandma was having a stroke inside.
This definitely confirms my analysis on Steve Rogers dying in Infinity War part 2 and probably Tony Stark dying as well or at least retiring thus making Captain Marvel AKA OG Miss Marvel the new head honcho at Marvel especially because of her name that's also why they making her the most powerful she will probably be the new leader when the older Avengers retired
That old lady was a dirty skrull
That old lady at 1:29 had it coming
why is everyone after Grandma's life
When your grandma talks shit about the Avengers
Im just here for that short clip where she punches the baby boomer
Love the theme song, man of steel vibes. And grandma is probably  a skrull 😂🤣
Out of context, the old lady punch is the best thing I've seen all day
Trailer is no.1 bullshit
Sad Old Lady. hahaha ONE PUNCH in the Face. badass captain
*Punches the Grandma*
1:31 When your grandma tells you to get off that cell phone
Looks like one of those old xmen movies
who else would want to know who that old woman she punched was?
Those saying “captain marvel punched an old lady”, that “old lady” was most likely a skrull. Deviant Skrulls have pointed ears, corrugated chins, green skin. Most males are bald and have no facial hair. Females have full head of hair. Most Skrulls are physically malleable, able to alter their shape size, and/or color at will. Hope this helps
1:30 when grandmas intimidate you the cuteass smirk.
What makes her a hero: She punched Grandmamma
Holy shit 
She punched tf out of that old lady 😂😂😂
1:31 She punched an old women in the face (Probably a  Skrull) and also I saw Agent Coulson!!!
Bruh i died when she punches that old lady,but then again that old lady is a skrull
*Punches grandma*
Marvel need more scene hit old people
Right when it said be a hero she punches an old lady square in the jaw on a public bus, makes me want to see it more now just to know why
More like captain Hit Old Ladys in the Face
Ive had more exciting shits...
What were you all expecting from a snippet trailer? This is a comic book movie with shape shifting villains and I'm pretty sure the old lady is one of them. Every hater of this trailer is going to spend their money in march.
I HAVE A THEORY.....do I have your attention. Good, so in this movie fury has 2 eyes.... For now. In the Winter Soldier fury had an argument with cap stating that the last time he trusted someone he lost an eye, he never states who it was so here's the theory....... WHAT IF in this movie, fury loses an eye for some reason having to do with captain marvel and makes him lose his trust in her, therefore he has either locked her up OR sent her to space away from Earth. This would explain why fury never called her in any other battles. Because he thought he couldn't trust her..... Until you know *cough* *cough*  SPOILERS: people start to disappear including fury himself. So thats my theory you don't have to agree with it but it's what I think, if any one has something to counteract that I would gladly listen.. I don't want to go to a movie  with a theory that is already proven wrong without me knowing.
Did Captain Marvel just punched an old lady?!!
Oh no!! She punched granny good luck escaping
Who thought its fan made after seeing the thumbnail😂😂...................hit like if u do....  😉😉
punches an old lady
My goodness she just slapped a granny!!
the old lady wasn't a skrull
R.I.P Stan Lee died 95 years old 1922-2018/19
It’s not even Brie’s fault. The trailer itself was awful. Really bad edit. Way too much shit that showed nothing in particular. A load of random clips. That’s not how you make a trailer. This is barely a Teaser Trailer. Very unimpressed. And I thought they knew how to make trailers. Doctor Strange was badass. Infinity War was just insane (not a good comparison though). Well, not even Marvel can win them all I guess.
Damn she cant act for shit... Monotone af
Please have her actually cold clock an elderly
Did she smack the old lady? LOL
Dude did she just sock an old lady
Green lantern level shit lol
1:30 when your grandma puts raisins in her cookies instead of chocolate chips
Only Marvel can make socking an old lady epic😭😭😭
This looks like 90s type shit not feeling it sorry
Female makes it a shitty tralier
I guess that old lady was THANOS..!!
Captain Marvel punched an old lady
hei thats my grandma you punch!!
And an old lady skrull just got her feelings hurt.
This looks shit
The old ladies probably a skrull
Caption old lady puncher
*when she smacked the old lady* BAD CAROL BAD CAROL
I don't know why she punched old lady.........??
you have no idea. tired of listening to this idea shit from nick fury again and again. he doesn't have any idea how bored we are
Grandma had it coming.
Do people still watch shitmovies like this? Ayy lmaaaoooo
I hope there's more walopping old people's faces in this movie. Best MCU moment so far.
punches old ladie 😂
Yes fellow commenters, please pick apart this movie because of trailer, because you know, it is just another shitty MCU movie. And we all know what they're track record has been!
1:30 poor granny..😂😂
I want to watch a spinoff where everyone she punches is actually a human being.
I remember the old times
To everyone mocking how she "punched an old lady in the face", you have heard of disguises right? It's not a new thing, especially when aliens are involved correct?
I love old people so I think I might be pretty disturbed by this when I see it.
"Discover what makes a hero" next frame: punches an old smiling woman 
This looks like baked-shit 🙁 💩
Slaps an old women lol
Captain marvel punches a old lady.......
oh no, not the grandma
she be saving us from old ladies 
Punching up old women my kind of super hero
01:30 When grandma keeps asking when you're going to "settle down."
that trailer was shit
This seems soo shitty.....well imagine hela being cap marvel....wud of luvd to see her..
1:31 when your grandma forces you to eat food when you’re not hungry
Hold up, was that Coulson?
Another shit movie for Tards to waste their money on. Shiny objects are attractive.
1:31 rip old hag...🤣🤣🤣 Lol
Hold up when's the new avengers part 2 out that's what I'm waiting for 👍
That hit on granny 🤣
So loki is impersonating that grandma I guess 😂😂😂
OK OK Ok OK Ok OK OK Ok OK Ok Not Bad Marvel knows Their Shit.
did she just punch a grandma
hit like for brie larson😍😍
Those 3 shots of young/ cadet/ pilot Carol Danvers standing in defiance at the 1:40 Mark with the choir swelling in the background alone have me sold! THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE SO FLIPPING EPIC!!! :-)
Looks good well I can guarantee it will be better than the shit film of black panther
Another shit to make us mad....
1:30 Did She Just Punch A Old Lady?
No offense, but she seems like a really shit actor. (not saying this because she's a girl, her acting is just very bad)
Old but- DC dies in it😫
I hope that was just a normal old lady who did absolutely nothing wrong
1:31 when grandma doesn’t give cash on your birthday
Brie Larson told me this movie isn't for me. The addition of "A HERo" seems to indicate this is also not for me because of my gender. So, I'll be skipping this nonsense. Enjoy your gender/race politics.
50% talking about grandma
Knocking out old ladies like most captains, military and team captains after a few beers lol in my opinion I think the old lady is a skrull shape shifter as I can't see marvel letting one of its characters beating an old woman up
Boring, blah, meh trailer. Only good part was grandma getting punched.....
After 10 years, the MCU needs to die. When Disney is losing hundreds of millions off of their slowly fading franchise, they are going to realize that even sheep get tired of the same old thing eventually.
Captain marvel- punches an old lady.
Wait she punched an old lady in the face? Is that what superheroes did back then?
It was all boring until grandma got punched in the face
I feel like this film is just so Marvel can say that they have a female lead in case DC fans ever attack but truth be told it's like a rip-off of super girl, superman and wonder woman. 
RIP for you grandma 😌
Damn she abused that old lady
*punches old lady with super human strength*
Grandma getting punched was the best part of this trailer😂
Fury from Cap America Winter Soldier be like: About dang time. 
Sammy is young nick fury here. Expect some John Wick type shit with his fight scenes.
shit just got real
Already looks pretty shit the actor talks like a brick wall
Just what we need, someone to deal with those pesky old ladies on public transports.
Rip Grandma 👵🏻 🔫 👱🏻‍♀️
I think grandma is the Scrolls
Hit like for captain Marvel
1:31 - when grandma says “how do we get to the camera”
How dare u punch my grandma.
stop making bullshit heroes
ok,,is this even real?? still cant hold my breath,,, damn this is amazing!!!!
This might break infinity war trailer views. Shit getting like a million views per hour...... WAS
Thats my granny
The way she slapped that old woman is a precursor of how she finna slap Thanos
So she will be the strongest avenger absolute bullshit if she is more powerful than thor..
She punched the shit out of that old woman 😂😂
She slapped an old lady..
1:30 when grandma made oatmeal instead of chocolate chip cookies
1:31 It now a meme (rip old lady)
Did she kill a old lady?
1:30 hah she punched that granny
Hold my beer. Im gonna go to the future.
Punching old ladies in the face is what makes a real hero...
1:31 When grandma doesn’t bake you cookies before you go home
i hope that old lady she punched in the face was a Skrull in disguise
We're out here beating old ladies
What if thanos just goes back in time and punches her in the face?
the mary poppins trailer is better than this shit
Nick Fury is putting a ice pack on his left eye and holding a gun while the surgeon is performing an autopsy on a skrull alien.
She just hit an old lady? Or is that like a scroll
edit: Im fully aware of the old lady skrull
she killed the old granny ? cool
RIP that grandma...!!
People who have no idea who skrulls are, are going to be really confused when she punched that old lady in the face.  😂😂😂
This trailer looked badass till I heard her voice. Should've sounded more of a mature and veteran sounding voice. Considering the fact it's not supposed to be an origin movie so obviously she's seen some shit. But honestly who are we kidding, Brie Larson is talented af and marvel will always take my money.
Bro how she gonna punch that grandma in the face like that tho
Holy shit Blockbuster Video
The old lady is actually an old lady and not a Skrull.
I feel bad for the old lady
That would be funny as shit if that old lady was just a normal old lady that wouldn't give up her bus seat.
to those saying "OMG SHE PUNCHED AN OLD LADY" that wasnt an old lady...that was a skrull (skrulls can change how they look)
Best clip: Punching the old lady in the face. No shame.
Oh gosh, what did Tahiti do to Coulson?
Yay another same old boring marvel movie CANT WAIT TO NOT WATCH IT
Punching the old lady he?
"How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old woman?!"
poor tht old lady get punch by brie larson
Loved the trailer!! I jumped when she punched the old lady lmfaoooo
Well the old lady got punched🤔
Only interesting moment was hitting the old lady. After that little much of anything stands out from being extremely generic, I’m concerned but still intrigued enough, hopefully the second trailer will be better
The only thing I’m not sold on in this Captain Marvel trailer is Captain Marvel yet 😂😂🙌🏻
captain marvel punching the old lady is the most powerful moment in cinema history
Carol is still shit...but 1:36 is my shit!
That punch to the 80 year old lady was Marvel knocking the shit out of DC
Rip the old lady Like if you agree xD
(Punches granny in the face)
I came back from the dead to watch her punch an old lady
loki is the grandma
Sometimes, you have to get up early in the morning... to take a big shit
*Punches an elderly woman
Carol just punched that old lady in the face! Tricky Skrulls cant fool Captain Marvel!
Punches old lady in the face - *explosion*
oh shit blockbusters
Can the old lady be Stan lee
What a shitty pointless feminist movie. HER O, was that even neccessary? Waiting for Avengers 4
Wait hold on. Why is everyone still alive after thanos snap his fingers before...weird
The lesson of the film punch old ladies😂
i have faith, the mcu has never made bad movies. even the worst ones make a shit ton of money and get decent reviews. Shes in good hands
People are arguing about the old lady , go and read old comics you will get your answer she is a alien.
*90% of the comments:* Why she punch an old lady?
No! Not the grandma! 😭
If she doesn't care what white people think I guess she doesn't want money from white people either
BLOCKBUSTER!! Holy shit..pagers...my childhood all over selling weed outside the local Blockbuster. Marvel is on fire man. I would like one good D/C movie besides The Watchmen.
Did she just punch a granny?
Did she just hit a grandma??
I meannnn idk why y’all niggas tripping about the trailer when the shit don’t come out until bloody april. You act like they gone show us some wild shit
Just so everyone knows, grandma is an alien. 👽
Ohhh the old lady scene will be way better if the old man is Stan Lee🤣🤣🤣 😎
This is what  nick  told in the last part of infinity war  after credits.  
Marvel's fan's hit the link
Btw! Am I the only one who is bored in these movies where is a huge fighting scene where none dies and the conclusion is that nothing happened. Only thing which happens is that things break up and then there is some bold and the beautiful styled drama..
*Punches an old lady in the face*
Haha guys this is just a sneak peak of the movie. What if grandma was some kind of villain in disguise... hehe.. let’s wait and just watch it 😊
i will be very dissapointed if Captain Marvel kills Thanos.yeah, she's a great character, but i think that drax the destroyer should give thanos the final hit, just like in the comics
Wonder woman was better than this bullshit
Disliked because she hit a grandma
Grandma Skrull got knocked tf out
Oh shit, wtf omg lol
Show dat grandma not to fuq with u!
Oh shit i think it's gonna be great
i was doubting the trailer until she punched the old lady
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old (wo)man! - 🐟
Why did she punch an old lady? Because she's not Wonder Woman.
Look at that lovely old lady smile, (CM punches here in face)🤗...
Getting kinda wore out on this girl power bullshit.
I think Captain Marvel was being controlled by someone when she was hitting that old lady or maybe it was clone of Captain Marvel I guess
Ima punch a grandma.
looks like absolute shit...can we stop with the super hero movies....whatever happened to great american classics like  goodfellas.....we need more talented writers..preferably non jewish
1:31 when grandma says "are you sure you are not hungry?" for the 5th time in the last 20 minutes.
Isn't punching grandma violence against women?
When you only see your granny for baked goods, and she ain’t got shit.
Old lady is obviously a Skrull
Old lady:I will trade you my pidgey for your dragonite
What did Captain Marvels fist say to Grandmas Face?   B A M ! 
Where is Ryan Reynolds, oh wait this is not green lantern
Eh, don't care about "chick flicks", how they copy every male superhero into some female counterpart (now or before). And then the movie companies try to cash in on that fast. Gets old very fast.
why Envy adams just wreckt that old lady
1:31 That punch was balanced, like all things should be
My biggest question is why did she punch that old lady at 1:30 ?!?!?!
I expected the white Nick Fury
1:30 skrull grandma 👵
And you can't just go around punching old ladies, Carol!
Wait, you punched granny
That her punch a old woman.I think the old woman is skrull
1:30 When you just wanted cookies, but the tin is full of grandma's sewing shit.
Plot twist 1:31 is actually an old woman 😂
lol what a grandma slammer
1:30 when your mom is yelling at u and ur grandma doesnt back u up like usual
Reading the confusion in the comments section about carol punching an old lady is both entertaining and annoying
Real captain marvel(Shazam) wouldnt hit the old grandma.
tbh i kinda expected more from their first trailer but still looks awesome. My favorite part is when she smacked that old woman skrull
That old lady got rekt 😂
1:31 she just beat an old woman
When granny doesn’t give you the cookies 1:31
She’s gonna smack the shit out of thanos
Okay, I get that the old woman is probably a Skrull, but punching an old lady in conjunction with "she's a hero"?
Why sid she hit a grandma on the face?  Must be some disguised villian
So no one is going to mention how she punched the grandma on her face?
Some green lantern shit
Can’t wait for their movie but this trailer was shit
Man that grandma got bitch slapped
Poor grandma 😂❤
Punch an old lady 
Finally, a hero who punches old ladies!
*In 2019 we will see old women getting punched*
Everyone's talking about how great she is. And it _is_ great that they finally have a female lead, but...she punched an old lady, for _smiling_ at her...
yo hold on for a second lemme just punch this poor old lady right in the head
lmao another Marvel shit
I feel bad for the old lady :/
*she hits the grandma*
She punched the shxt out of that old lady😂😂😂😂
The old lady is probably a Skrull.
Bet they would remove that 'punching old lady/skrull' scene in the final cut LMAO.
How old is Captain Marvel in the comics? Because she sounds like a high schooler...
Except the part she beats up the Grandma
Did she just punch and old woman in the face, Some hero she is.
Well that looks like a loud of feminist bullshit
shit i feel hyped omg
*its a legit old lady*
EDIT: tbh can we get more ethnic people in general? Most of the hero’s in marvel are all male or white or both . Add more diversity.
IGN 1/10 - not enough granny punches
I know there is a reason for it, but out of context, she hit an old lady lol.
That Grandma in the trailer is certainly the wife of Thanos
WOAH WOAH WOAH hold it 1:30
Like it when she punched the old lady.
That HER..A HERO bullshit nixed me from seeing this feminst bullshit
Poor granny...Lol...She might be a villian in disguise.
Captain Feminism traveled a long way to fight the patriarchy and will destroy the wage gap by shooting energy beams from her hands and punching old ladies.
i'd pay $13 to see an old lady get punched in the face.
Wtf 1:30 don't worry granny iam  here 😢😢😢
Captain Marvel: Old Woman 1:31

Prev. Comment "Cos of that grandma I'm gonna watch all the movie in theatre! It must be great! And... all this theme is superduper!". 
Ah yes. True heroes ALWAYS punch elderly woman in the face.
Dislike because Trump told me to
My lesbian neighbors gave me a rolex for my birthday....I think they misunderstood when I told them I wanna watch.

Dc fans hit like
Showed that old lady no mercy
Wait until thanos spank the shit out of dis girl
who gives a shit about the trailer if it's good or not the only thing that matters it's the movie. There are amazing movies with bad trailers such as Braveheart, hellboy, rare window, star wars episode IV a new hope you can't judge a movie from it's trailer
Wtf she punched that old lady ..
Skrulls. Yung Fury. Yung Coulson. I'm sold.
Holy shittttt!!!!!
Hold on a moment.  Capt. Marvel is a tranie?  Say it ain't so!  What the heck happened here.  I remember him from when I was a kid in the 50s at the movies and I'm sure it was a dude.
So uh....we’re just gunna ignore the fact that she just punched an old lady in the face at 1:30......
The old Captain Marvel is gonna make an appearance!
Ohhh shittttt 1:30
Did she hit a old woman??? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Thanos has no chance
I wanna see her beat the ever living shit outta thanos in part 2
me when grandma din't cook food.
My favorite part is when she knocks the shit out of the old lady
Marvel fan hit like
Oh shit ok Marvel I see you.
Well this looks like shit
Why’d she punch that ol’ white lady though....?
I hope that old woman isn't a Krull
69k old Women figured out how to use the internet and disliked this video 😂
Let’s see how old they can get
Punches a old lady in the face
i hope she wont be the superman of the mcu being way way op and just punching thanos to death and single handedly save the day. i am really sceptical about cpt marvel to say the least. i hope she doesnt, as a character, ruin the mcu. also im not sure if i would've went with brie larsson as my first choice.
Looks like a shitty cw series from the arrowverse
Awesome, but wtf she punched a grandma? 😯
Sold, take my damn money
And then a meteor hit the earth
Overrated shit.... This is far from the level of previous movies.... Hope the storyline will satisfy us.
1:28 What makes her a Hero? Punching old ladies on the bus! 😂 I had no idea old ladies were such a threat.
"A HERO" *beats up old lady on the bus*
Wtf? She killed a Grandma
I didn’t like the preview for Thor: Ragnarok and that movie turned out to be awesome. I’m going in cold because I never read up on Captain Marvel.
Or D. Show C.M beat the shit out of an old lady
Who else got hit with nostalgia when they saw that Blockbuster store? Omg...I remember that place being candyland when I was younger. Everybody didn't know what the heck this "Netflix" thing was when it swooped in with all it's commercials. Hulu and Redbox were a thing of the far future. Blockbuster was getting off on charging the biggest late fees on returns...you had to get that shit back ON TIME. Wow, it's funny, looking back.
Nothing but white supremacy. Reported this video to google.
1:30 When your grandma sends you clothes for your birthday.
The punching an old lady part is a confirmed meme at this point
Thanos is shitting himself right now!
So basicly they're implying that Captain Marvel has been around for awhile. In that case, I'm gonna need an explanation for why she hasn't been around for the several catastrophes that have been going on since the 90's up till now and why it took the ending of Infinity War for Fury to finally wanna give her a call. Not trying to nitpick, its just necessary information we need in order to understand that age old question, "WTF is going on?"
Discover... What makes... A hero... *Punches an old lady*
What happened to all the cute girls? I am sick of the girl next door bullshit - Golden Age of Hollywood time again please!  Rita Haywood, Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner, Jane Mansfield etc cos movies are boring if you ain't got something stimulating to look at for an hour and forty minutes!
*oh my shit* this looks so lit
i love how this is 3 days old yet still #1 on trending
its the second best after infinity war i loved it  who liked it hit like
That granny got bitch slapped OOOO
Am i the only one getting pissed at people thinking she punched an old lady for no reason
1:30 when ur grandma puts more food on your plate
Really hope that old lady isn't a Skrull.. because there are times when old people just need a good ol Knuckle sandwich
When she punches the old lady... Gold!
Yo she just punched an old lady in the face 😂😂😂

My bi ass can't take this shit
“discover what makes her a hero” punches old woman right after*
When she punches the old lady...
*Punches an alien*
The old lady must be a skrull lol
Blockbuster!!!! So many good memories and wow this looks great and her hitting that skrull disguised as old lady!
Poor old lady got slapped 😢
Ithink they had her Frozen or some shit
You know shits about to get real when there in no jokes in a marvel trailer!!!!!
The moment i saw the scene where she punches the old lady i knew it was gonna be a meme lol
The protagonist hitting an innocent Grandma. Unless the Grandma is the antagonist, I already don't like this movie!
When u hit a old person make it count
Hit like if you think my profile pic is more popular and favourite then any other Avenger
*OMG.... Did She Just Hit The Grandma???? 😱😱*
1:31 punching an old lady? Tell me more.
So are we just going to ignore the fact that she sucker punched that poor grandma in the face
The old lady punch was epic af
Scence she punched an old lady, im going to assume the rumors are true, and the bad guys are the scrull
She's ruthless hitting that old lady lol 
That poor old lady
Why punch the old lady
*Old woman: Where is your butt??
Eat shit Wonder Woman/Gal Gadot
CAPTAIN MARVEL A HERO! ... brokes a grandmas nose...
She punched granny.. Hahaha
Ah, the good old days of Blockbuster!
She punched the shit out of that old lady🤣🤣🤣
1:31 punching grandma. Thats a goofy manner. Haha
all the same shit......
To punch an old lady like that, she must’ve deserved it 😂 IT’S ACTUALLY COMING OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY 😆
I'm not afraid to hit a old person in public!
I can't tell but is that Brie Larson also as the Old Lady?
she knocked the shit out of that old lady.. was that agent carter?
We just hitting grandma’s now?
they purposely didn't show her on the outfit, this trailer was the first so they can hit people when their expectations are low.
This is gonna be the one that stops thanos? Bullshit.
Hit like if you are here before a million views
Bro she punched an old lady
Looks like shit, Marvel has their grip of death on me tho so you already know imma be there opening night
Carol Danvers punches an old woman in the face. Great way to tease a skrull appearing in the movie.
Since she did hold her own against 5 stones while destroying one
Worst Marvel Hero, she punches old ladies.
WB Just needs to sell DC to Disney so this shit gets done right.
She went on a space mission but returned back to earth with extraordinary superpowers and very few memories of her past. Now Skrulls who are a new threat from cosmos have planned some serious shit. Nick and Phil meet her and persuade her to join the fight against Skrulls. She initially refuses but later agrees to Nick’s request and finally ends up defeating the main antagonist. Post credit scenes will definitely be related to Avengers 4.
Thank goodness there's finally a faithful rendition of a female Marvel big hitter. Rogue was supposed to be great but they turned her into a weepy shrieky teenager.
Iron man fanss hit like pls 💥😍😍😍
Yo, did she just punch an old lady in the face??
*Literal next shot is her punching an old lady
I swear if they gonna do Thanos like Dc did to steppenwold, i would sue marvel(not really though)
Well only For Carol Danvers that Grandma has none.
Hit like for nick👍👍
So many people fighting about nonsense in these comments, how are we not focusing on how interesting the story seems? This seems to be a totally different genre from any other Marvel adventure. Where everything else has been a superhero action movie, this looks like a spy-buddy cop movie featuring the origin story from someone we know and love plus a complete new character. Marvel has been slowly pushing from the superhero genre label, but this looks like a full departure. I guess after Black Panther and Thor 3 they saw successes on riskier (relatively) story leaps. Then with Infinity War they saw people are invested enough in Marvel to push a movie featuring dozens of established characters to number one in the box office. Maybe we could say Winter Soldier was a spy movie, but it still tricked most people into thinking they were watching a superhero movie- Captain Marvel doesn't pretend at all. I'm excited to see a buddy cop movie featuring SAMUEL L JACKSON as the grizzled old timer? How will Brie Larson earn the everlasting respect from this hard boiled super spy? Remember, he had the radio on him when Thanos snapped. He must have it at all times for real emergencies- ones where the Avengers are down. He already has them for alien invasions or robot apocalypses. Captain Marvel? She can't out punch Thor or Hulk. She won't be able to come near to taking Thanos down on her own. No, she's bringing something new. I'm excited to see what.

1:31 When your grandma puts raisins in your cookie
lol obviously this girl gonna kill thanos she just punch an old lady not even tony have heart to do it
Okay, i just watched Captain Marvel obliviously punch an OLD LADY!
1:30 When your grandma doesn't stop kissing your lips every 10 minutes.
Waiting for Tamil dub fans hits like
Hit like if you saw Stan Lee ❤ in the trailer!!!
Man this shit going to good. I have to admit I did have my doubts though.
What I took away from this trailer  : sucker punching old ladies makes you a hero
In case you dont know skrulls have the power to copy people and look like humans. So the grandma is actually a skrull. GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT
Cap marvel : punch that Granny 
I'm just saying she probably had a very good reason for punching that old lady in the face.
1:30 Did she just punch that woman in the face? Damn. Elder abuse.
Nick Fury is older than most folk think go back circa WW-2 there was another serum....
a female hero that bleeds every mouth. i'm not sold on the stupid ideal, captain maxi-pad.
She just hit an old woman
Looked shitty won't be seeing that in theatres
Did she... she just... punched a.... an old lady??
•captain marvel beats old ladies
Now THIS is epic. Nah I’m serious this looks really good. Plus she punched an old lady so that’s a plus.
........Please explain why you had to hit poor granny infront 20 people?
@1:31 Hey guys if you are questioning why captain marvel punched an old lady, maybe my theory is that the old lady is a shape-shifting alien, or is what we called a Skrull
Grandma: Marvel sucks!
This shit is gonna be a vemon gonna be better then this shit and he anti-hero
Now what did grandma ever do to her
When your grandma dont have cookies *skip to minute **1:29**-1;32*
1:30 That poor grandmother so old and kind and healthy until this happends
A movie abut a female superhero... yeah dislike and not seen this shit
"So-called 'hero' punches old lady, more at 11:00"
Why did the Granny getting punched in the face go under the serious music? Guys, know your moments!
I am a writer and artists. This movie don't look that good. It is a Superman wannabe.  Larson told me to F Off, I am a critic and movie goer, lover and writer. I do not like Larson, she is a bad actor. I am sorry. The graphics look lazy. My right. If you delete my comment, you are bigot. I am deaf. I am tired of Marvel, many of their movies are generic and boring. You need to do better. stop being lazy and stop listening to a tiny group. You  Normal folks need to stop watching garbage, yearly releases make movies bad. Marvel just take some time off, make better movies. The last few movies been boring.
This movie might be a flop the story line isn't that good plus it's an introduction of a old hero in the newest way
Oh look,loki disguised as a granny ;-)
Şehitler ölmez vatan bö❤ 
Old ladies could get it too
Awesome trailer It s gonna be a blockbuster hit movie
ugly shit hahaha
Her: **punches old woman in face**
Why did she hit the old lady
She smacked the shit outta that old lady

1:30 just got hyped! Poor old lady or is she an old lady?
she punched an old lady
we all know she didnt punch her...when u dont see the impact -> punch not real ...just a fight choreography ...
The old lady is so happy on receiving a punch😍😍
Yikes I feel like everything Marvel touches turns to gold but this casting is wickety wickety wack? Meh.
Why does this look shit and why does the acting already look bad
That poor old lady tho...
Holy Shit why the CGI looks so inconsistent? some parts looks good and other parts like hot garbage?
finally a movie not afraid to show what audiences really want. An old Lady straight up getting punched in the face
You just dont punch grandma!! Thats grandma!!
I now just hate Marvel. When the world gets to the stage that it needs antman 2 and this shit then that's when I know I'm done with Marvel and DC. There are so much better movies out there. Amazing stories and characters. Mind-blowing directors.
1:31 did she just hit an old lady
Who else died when she hit the grandma XD
Punching old leadies (marvel)
did she just punched an OLD LADY!
Her script and voice acting sound like dogshit. She sounds likes she’s totally reading off a paper, not with real emotion
when she punched the lady got me thinking " ive fallen and cant get up vibes " smh
That old lady is a skrull
beat grandma but she wamen so it's okay
Seriously though, She is one of the strongest heavy hitters but making her the strongest with no build up or anything will just be lame.
Why captain marvel hits that old lady
Once I saw blockbuster.. childhood memories have been brought back. Do you feel old yet? :(
That Poor Old Lady.
I lost faith in this movie as soon as I saw her punch the old lady. 1:29
1:31 Punch a Nazi aka Trump Supporter. 
She punchin grandmas?????
Holy shitballs.
Shit trailer 3/10
Omg she just punched the shit out of that grandma....
They know they had anyone 90s babies and older hooked once they threw in that Bloc Buster...
Punching an old lady😳 No no no this movie ain't nfor kids
umm I watched it a million times and I cant find the part where she beats up an old lady..
3 - Then she punches her, out of nowhere, like we see in the trailer.
Grandma > Thanos
Same thing happens with all super man movies. She's gonna be another  "The most powerful" piece of shit like Superman. DC will be so happy 🤣
1:30 For people who dont know Skrulls are Shapeshifters otherwise this Hero just punched an Old Lady for Fun
She punched an old lady ;-;
Okay ... I will assume the old lady was an undercover skrull 😓
Shit man every time marvel post a trailer, iam so happy and count the days till it starts to play in the cinema
What a bull shit
Holy shit that's coulson
Grandma left the chat
Damn clockin the "old lady"
She slapped that old lady!!!!!!🤣
Man, when she punches the Grandma Skrull haha. I bet so many people who don't know what the shape shifting Alien race of Skrulls are, probably just thought, "why'd she hit that old lady!?" lol. I love it.
Old Lady: there are more than 2 genders
1:30 when grandma says no more video game time
1:31 dude did shejust kick the shit out of granny
Disliked by thanos and his chitauri army
Captain Marvel: *punches old lady*
Punching old people makes you a hero
This isn't a sexist issue. Male actors get criticized for lacking emotion. The new superman people hated for no smiling. Wonder Woman was a hit with everyone. A female lead superhero. Marvel, don't be Star Wars. Marvel Fans who cry sexism. Don't be Star Wars fans who cry sexism. This is how you break a franchise. Star Wars is proof that you are never too big to fail.
but most importantly see breaky granny
The lady getting punched in the face had me dead
Did she just punched an old lady 😂
That old lady punch though !
Guys the grandma that she slapped was actually black widow
478784 that the view number I had, I'll comeback here when this hit millions
This is some green lantern wannabe shit right here
I am actually more excited to see Glass and Mary Poppins. Is that weird? And......did she just punch an old lady?
I don't about ya'll but Jude Law just sold the whole movie to me 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The very fact that she has to punch lets you know that she ain't on the level of a Jean Grey or  a Scarlet Witch they are way above and beyond physical combat.
I feel like marvel took a risk with her punching that lady who was obviously a skrull but for people who don’t know would probably get mad
Why she had to hit that old lady?
That poor Grandma.
DC is so desperate that its disguising itself as Grandma now.
My curiosity went through the roof when she punched that old lady.
Of course it has to be YET AGAIN another white person playing a superhero.. SMH!
Yoooooo, that grandma at 1:31 has to be a Skrull.
People don't get satisfied with anything, truth to be told: THIS trailer is awesome, and the movie will be THE hit.
Captain Marvel: punches grandma
Wow I knew this would be shitty, but wow. Brie larson is just... awful. 
The grandma is DC trying to mooch a bit off of Marvel’s fame.
1:31 yeeees, punch that Skrull
Oh the memes that are gonna come from that old lady punch
Plot twist: The grandma is Mystique (X-men)
Don't forget, trailers don't mean shit. Hell, BvS looked awesome from the first trailer.
Too she just decked an old lady, Marvel y'all wilinn!!
Disappointed, this hater of white men, talks to much, hope marvel made this a budget movie, cause it’s gonna tank
Did she just punch a old lady? Wtf lmaooo
Her goes to hero LOL another Mary sue this movie is gonna be shit
*punches smiling old lady* oh ok.
Soldier from tf2 says: I AM HAVING A HEART ATTACK!! YAAAYYY
Don't think hitting an old lady is heroic
She beating old ladies bruhh
I couldnt help but chuckle when I saw marvel girl punch the old lady. It was so out of place.
I love that a functioning Blockbuster store is used to establish this film as a period piece. Man, I feel old.
Feminism = punching an old lady ?
Why does she punch a grandma
1:30 When Grandma forgets your name
Where the heck is Iron Man 3. Waiting since a long time.. bullshit. Marvel answer me..
"Now.. while we don't advocate beating up on elderly folks.. that old Skrull definitely had it coming." - Nick Furry
Grandma showed more acting in 1 second  than the Captain Marvel in whole trailer
okay let’s not drag this movie yet, let’s just pray that it’ll be fantastic when it hits movies.
Holly shitt that will be awesome..!!!
She punched the shit out that old woman....😂😂😂😂😂was NOT expecting that
Its like a shitty WB show but a movie.
She hits old ladies...
Lets give a round of applause for Blockbuster videos making a cameo in the movie lmao! Blockbuster videos been dead for ages and for it to make it all the way to the big screen and on Marvels boy you know you hit big time than ahahaha!  Now for all the grandmothers out there for stealing cookies and shit lol!  Warning this is what happens when you steal, Captain Marvel punches your ass LOL!!!
1:30 when grandma comes round and tells u to get off fortnite
Damn u punch the shit out grandma😂   like her dentures was glued tf in tho it didn't came out😂😂
Did you noticed something? In Captain America: The Winter Soldier Nick Furry says “Last time i trusted to someone, i lost my eye”
Blockbuster... that's cold!  Coooooold!
*Sees grandma scene*
Is there a reason I am supposed to be impressed by a young lady punching an old lady?!
I think the old lady will be the villain of this movie
Okay so why did she punch the old lady? XD
Fat kid: Hey, grandma! How about another grape soda?
*punch*
i love how nick fury says they have no idea what threats are out there, and then it immediatly cuts to captain marvel punching an old lady in the face
O.  She hitted her grammy
She hit an Old woman.
Can’t wait to see her punch that old woman’s face on the big screen
Did she just punch an old lady?
Shit 💩 going to be the worst marvel movie
Maybe having a super hero cold clock an old lady without knowing about the shape shifting Aliens will look bad
In later news: woman boycotts Marvel due to child punching grandmother in the face.
Was confused with the old lady punching until I remembered the Skrulls are this movie's villains
What makes her a hero? Punching grandmas.
Like hit for the real captain Steve rogre
One more shit 🙄 watched the trailer with excitment but didnt find any wow or special thing in it...🙄😒 Waste movie...
Old folks need to be kept in check. Captain Marvel is on the ball.
Shet why she  punch the old lady!?!?!
Thanos: when I am done half of humanity will still exist                           cap marvel: when I am done half of old ladies will still exist
Marvel fans hit like
Man y it gotta be the old.latty lol
Our savior from Old hags ....
Poor old woman lol
This will be shit movie😑
Soooooo amazing I’m so so so excited love you marvel studios plus I want to make move s when I’m older love marvel
Old lady was probably a skrull in disguise
Why she had to duff the old lady 😂
*I'm NOT going to watch this trailer.* I'll watch this movie raw without ant Spoilers and Shit.
so this is the hero to save us all *looks at the comments* ok maybe we should get cara theobold to play as squirrel girl or peter cullen as adam warlock or anyone
This isn't a movie for straight white men, said Ms.Larson... She sure spared me 2 hours of boredom. Thank you, Brie !
Well I think the old lady is one of those shape shifting aliens.
Why captain marvel punch that old lady
1:31 That old lady is a scroll !
Another shit movie
20,000 grandmas disliked
1:34 if you have that shit years ago why don't use it to help avengers against aliens in first movie🤔🤔
That old lady is a disguised skrull!!!
1:30 She punched the old lady 😲😲
Manz wait half a year for dis shit
Şehitler❤ 
1:31 grandma:are u texting ur boy friend
1 like = 1 prayer 1grandma.
She still isn't as old as cap
1:31 Kid: Grandma can I get a candy bar
1:30 when grandma doesn't give you a batch a cookies
U talk smack about white men than you can expect a small hit in overall purchases. It would've been better if she kept her anti white male mouth shut.
I wanna see that old lady's after punched face 1:31 ...🤣
Lmfao when the old woman smiles at her and she punches her in the face
It will not sell in China or Asian countries because of 1:30. Marvel would be smart to reupload the trailer without that one scene, cut that scene completely out of the movie, replace it with Captain Marvel helping that old lady, and then Marvel Entertainment should apologise profusely for suggesting violence against the elderly (no matter the story, or if the lady was like a wolf in sheep's skin).
But....the granny 😥
What better way to appeal to the image of a strong and righteous hero than having them punch an old lady with little to no context in a promotional trailer?
She punched my grandma I'm not gonna watch it..
Take that grandma. That's for getting me a knock-off. I clearly asked for Gucci.
You know it's sad that some people would just say oh it's another white person (for a Marvel character) but come on it's Captain/Ms Marvel whichever name you prefer to use.
There are only two shots showing white males. Guess anything else would be sexist and racist.
Grandma "Seats taken missy, move along"
Is this the real trailer or just another shity concept?
Way do she hit the grandma
01:30 Why she punch the old lady? F***!
Holy shit it’s a prequel
The trailer doesn't show much, just a lot of walking and posing with a few glimpses of brief action and character interactions, to say this movie is going to suck based on a snippet is just crazy, especially when we all know the track record of Marvel post Winter Soldier. Man of Steel had awesome trailers and we all know how that turned out(for those who didn't like it that is, I know some did)...The first trailer, good or bad, rarely determines the quality(or lack there of) of the actual film.
Wonder Woman ain't shit! Team Marvel forever!!!
Another shit super hero movie
so.....captain marvel beats up old Lady's now  lol
She’d still get shitkicked by wonder woman 
When she punched that old lady I was like WTF!!!!!!
Punching old ladies make her a hero.
#1 hit on youtube
Hit like for top 1 trending❤
Why beat grandmothers? It is necessary to file a complaint against you for contempt of the older generation!
Captain Marvel should be a man, not a fkn supergirl.. Thats lame as shit.
1:30 when grandma makes oatmeal resine cookies instead of chocolate chip
*hits old lady on a public bus*
I've like watched it seven times in a row but. ....dosen't fell old
Now its grandma next will be thanos
grandma: yes aids have been transferred
Captain Marvel, laying the smack down on nice old ladies since the 90s
What im wondering is why she punched the old lady
10,000 Skrulls are shitting in their spacesuits
Big marvel fan. But there's this 'Honesty is the best policy' thingy. So truth be told, I didn't like it. I wanted something more....grand, I guess? Didn't expect it to look this lame.
Here before it hits a million!
Shit trailer...
1:30 when your grandma asks if you’ve eaten for the 6th time
"I think I had a Grandma here but I can't tell if she's real, so I'm just going to knock her block off"
*proceeds to smack an old lady in the face*
Grandma: There are only 2 genders...
I need some context on the old lady punch.
A super hero punching an old lady , a reason to be watched ,..
*punches grandma in the face” at least she went for the head
Well the only think I did not like was the Her  to A Hero thing... They are trying to make it bout gender again.... THat is not a good idea... Captian Marvel is a good hero with out the gender bullshit.
Me: old lady=Thanos
(Grandma) want some candy dear? (Punch) ... K.O
Bullshit trailer
Old lady is probably a Skrull in disguise. The invasion he's talking about is a Skrull invasion.
Are you people ignoring my comments on purpose ??? I tryed everything : I did "old lady" jokes , I did Civil War 2 jokes , I even did "make Captain Marvel great again" jokes ! And I got only one like , only ONE !!!! Wtf is wrong with you ??? Is this some kind of a conspiracy against ol' pal Freeman ???
Omg omg omg omg i think i just shit my pants
First of all, this looks like it has some really nice potential. Marvel doesn't spoil stuff in their trailers like DC does, they save the best stuff for the actual movie. Second of all, anyone who has picked up a comic book or watched EMH would know that that old lady is a skrull and not a human. Third of all, this isn't feminazi bs because Captain Marvel has always been a woman and yes, she is a Captain, deal with it. About time a female superhero got her own Marvel movie.
You’re in my seat, old lady!!!!!
Did she just punch some old woman lmao?
damn that blockbuster scene brings back some old memories
Why she gotta hit the old lady like that? Damn.
Oh shit!
*spoiler* Grandma tells Ms. Marvel to wash her dirty space hair
she hits an old woman... i love it
Start your day by socking a old grandma you think is a alien lol
white empowered women,black dominant male character, another poc sidekick,over the edge 4th wave warped feminizm yo, whats not to like my dear goyim.I am so done with the whole entertainment industry.
she... she punched a granny
stan lee doing a cameo as old lady
It looks like it’s a good movie I just don’t know about the actor yet. all her lines just didn’t give me the punch I wanted 🥊
That old lady is definitely a skrull so don't get mad about it
Also, fairly certain Carol punching a grandmother (Kree in disguise) is already to be a GIF meme right about now....if anyone needs me, I'm waiting out for New Mutants. At least THAT looks different and unique from the other Marvel Studio properties.
Captain Marvel must really dislike old people
Damn that old lady just got *boxed in the face*
anyone else catch the scene where Fury had an icepack on his eye while holding a rifle as the surgeon was messing with some humanoid thing?
Why Punch Grandma?
I'm curious about whether Grandma Survives or not
Yes grandma abuse...
Old lady getting punched can't be serious
Block Buster tribute! And... Did she just punch an old lady? o-0
CGI Phil Coulson looks like shit

Why da old lady
Pretty lack luster but I'm pretty sure marvel will still hit the mark
Well expected the effects will be better like  guardians of the galaxy level. But theymgot the mask have white eyes but can't do the same for hela sucks. I wish the costume had that bandana in her hips.
Dafuq why she hit the old woman :/
How the single glimpse of a person can make you flip your shit a zillion times!!!!
Ok but why the hell she gotta punch the grandma fo 😂
Whe She Punch The Grandma?

By the way the best away to introduce a hero, is putting him to punch a granny in the face.
I'm really hoping that old lady was a Skrull💀💀
And that little old lady Capitain Marvel punched the shit out of
1:31 When your grandma bakes you oatmeal raisin cookies instead of chocolate chip

Old lady getting punched probably gonna be a meme soon
And she punches a grandma in the face like a boss. 
Punching old ladies in the face is tight.

36k dislikes from grandma lovers
I told everyone on YouTube shield is bigger than it looks
This is bullshit 100% dissatisfaction because captain marvel was never a woman so this movie will be absolute dog shit
I want her and Tony to have a drink. She hit rock bottom during Busieks run on avengers and iron man.
this about grandma?
I remember when everyone shitted on the guardian of the galaxy, saying it was going to bomb. Then everyone Saw The Movie. Let's not judge until we actually get to see this next year
Y she punch old wise lady :<
Grandma: I don't feel so good...
On The Bus when Captain Marvel Push Old Lady Face That is not

Bring deadpool to avengers 4! He will definately hit on captain marvel
*sees old lady smiling and punches her into oblivion*
1:30 when grandma only made you a 6 course meal
Did she just punch an elderly women
The dislikes are from old ladies and thanos
When you see a blockbuster you know this shits in the 90’s
And when punching out old ladies to get a seat on the bus was still ok.
1:31 Poor Grandma :'(
"Discover what makes her a hero" *cuts to her slapping a granny*
That Grandma could be a skrull in human form..just saying
what a piece of shit....
Loved seeing Phil and Fury. But Captain Marvel seems to much like shit the cw would produce.
grandma is a spy from tf2
*Old lady puncher*
.....shit....can't wait
She punched an old lady, I'm in.
the title card that sholud have been Shazam's. Still this looks like the shit
I can’t wait for when a “white male” reviews the movie and Brie Larson calls them a “racist, sexist bigot” lmfao
this looks like shit keep it up marvel
That old lady should sue caption Marvel...
35k people need to be grandma punched
I can’t be the only one who laughed in a wrong way when she slapped an old lady.
When grandma says, "when i was your age ............"
Feminist shit!!!!!!!😒😒😒👎👎👎
Of course some fans or could possibly DC fanboy said this is horrible and meh, at the same time they praised WW, Shazam, Aquaman, BvS, and Justice League. The way Carol punch the old woman is much better than the entire Wonder Woman CGI fighting. This is just teaser I guess. I expect more but I know Marvel always does like this.
Respect 2 grandma
This lools like doodoo like marvel i know this aint a real movie now lol so its alright to beat up old people lol
So close to 1M like ,Marvel fan let’s hit the like !

Wow, this looks like shit!
Did she just sucker punch a nice old lady?
She punched an old lady!! Im wheezing 😂😂😂
At 1:30 did she hit a grandma?
1:31 Granny KO LMAO
No mercy for the old lady
*Slaps an old lady* !!
So apparently only thing you have to do to de-age Samuel L. Jackson  25 years is give him hair... Good to know. (Also, did she just punch an old lady on a bus?!)
*slaps the crap out of grandma*
That grandma at 1:31 is a skrull I believe
She gave that granny a biggest slap even I felt it
I like it but it better not be some woman over men bullshit

Far better than wonder woman.hit like if you agree
"a hero"... proceed to punch old woman
She punched the shit out of that grandma
Where booster gold

I hope that the old lady was a skrull because Marvel wouldn't be promoting elder abuse XD
@1:30 When your grandma sided with Machine Gun Kelly.
Why did captain marvel punch a granny on the train
The only reason she hit the old lady is because she is a skrull duhhh
Good old BlockBuster
why!!!  why do marvel need another bullshit super hero! why!!
When grandma doesn't clean after herself 1:31
People are sold from an old lady being punched, wow simple minds these days.
The fact that Marvel is using blockbuster to illustrate that this movie takes place a long time ago makes me feel both old and sad that other people will never experience blockbuster.
Is it wrong I laughed when she right hooked an old woman. I mean that woman wouldve 720 through the bus window because Captain marvel is super strong right?
This has the same feel of the shitty CW series based on the DC universe like Supergirl. The acting and CGI are laughable....
The grandma didn't thank the bus driver.
Very disappointed.... Worst trailer ever... Can't imagine this type of shit from mcu... I would love to watch green latern rather than this nonsense movie..... U guys should focous on ironman 4... Don't try to make someone bigger than tony stark... Acctualy u can't
Yeah Marvel, show your newest hero punching an old lady for no apparent reason. Good means of advertisement.
What do you want to be for Halloween sweet daughter? CAPTAIN MARVEL!...now let's ride the subway so I can punch an old woman
WOW... and the hits just keep coming. From Marvel.
Did she just.. punch an old lady?? Yeah, very heroic SMH
I can't wait to see how fast she beats the absolute shit out of Thanos
1:30 when your grandma forgets to make chocolate chip cookies

The old lady 1:31 hahaha and she punches her
Well she punched that old lady too hard 😑
Bad trailler... I beat on the face to an old woman what values....:(
another super of the supers, nonsense why just create a hero that can defeat thanos, create one punchman or Goku !
She punches that old lady in the face... definitely the green ball sack chin guys
High key feel they put that old lady scene in the movie so it can later become a trending meme to make the movie more successful
5 º\º trailer  95 º\º grandma xd
Did you guys see her punch an old lady?
Same superpowers........jumping, pulling, pushing,flying, colliding cars, kind of electric slapshs....uufffff....but not the least punching grandmas!!!!!lol...trailer looks lame....hope movie rocks
1:31 yeah I also casually punch the shit out of old ladies when I'm in a train
Yo, this is a dope trailer but when will “Punching with Grandma Simulator 2018” release?
Remember, kids. Always punch old ladies across the face on the subway.
She just punched the shit out of that old lady.... Ima watch it.
Marvel: Hold my Tesseract **releases Captain Marvel trailer**
I don't like the actress.. Captain marvel should be like hela..that would be cool.. Otherwise this movie will be totally bullshit
Damn did she just brain that granny?
"What makes her a hero" *punches the old lady*
Ok, let's address the elephant in the room. That old lady is obviously a Skrull who is taunting Captain Marvel, and the punch is a moment of frustration and rage, because she knows who the old lady really is.
Grandma Skrull getting slapped 😂
“Discover what makes her a hero” immediately punches old woman in the face
RIP the old woman
Why does this give off a Man of Steel vibe ?  It looks a bit like shit..
Yes, Trebek, I'll take Grandma Punching for $800, please...
Well shit..... there will so many instagram post on Marvel Fanbase, and about a week later many people will make a trailer breakdown or trailer explained lol
Cant wait to find out why the old women got punched
What makes her a hero? Punching grandma
granny : look its shazam 
idk about you guys, but i don't think i am completely hooked up by this trailer, it feels so generic and mainstream, the only build up who caused people to hype i think is just the music, whith they deliberately pumps it up in every frames like they did in every marvel movies trailer..
Literally has a younger woman punching an old lady
What’s with her slapping the old lady on the bus? Lol
Finally, a super hero that hates old people as much as I do, they think they’re so entitled
only cool part I seen was when she punched that old lady 😃
Eminem's killshot was knocked off the number one trending spot for this piece of shit?
Captain Marvel punching an old lady?... yeah this is gonna be trash
This movie looks lit and the old lady is a shapeshifter
Omg poor old lady 1:31
Why did she just punch the old lady?
Looks kinda cheesy and shitty for marvel...sorry.
Trailer says a hero followed by captain marvel punching an old woman
*I feel bad for the Grandma*
it's going to be feminist shit
That's not an old woman!
She just rocked the shit out of an old lady. I definitely need to see this movie
shit trailer tbh
Captain Marvel vs Grandma
1:29 - 1:33  is the first time I have ever seen a super hero punch a smiling old lady in the face lol
Marvel, you denied us no shit sherlock joke. dont deny us "who's real captain" joke
So, she punched a granny? Well, here we are
Captain Marvel:Grandma
Oh shit. Youtube comment section is acting up again.
So Grandma is the villain????.....Thanos was better
In the UK in the news this superhero was supposed to be Muslim thank god but either way film looks shite
as expected looks like because its a female led film  all female led films are all usually shit
It's like superwoman, but a bit older and lame. Sigh..
Shits dope and all but I hope they don’t actually make her the “strongest character on screen by far” because that ain’t true at all
holy shit she look bored like a pissed of cashier
The old lady is obviously a Skrull the fact that her head didn't come off knowing how powerful Captain Marvel is, it just makes sense! People are like OMG THE OLD LADY! Just think people she is obviously a Skrull. 😂
Ok......she just punched the old lady in the face...
Did she just punched an old lady in the face?!
This movie will follow the same drone formula of the other Marvel movies the old lady is some shape shifting alien and we'll get some rushed and jumbled Captain Marvel back story that will absolutely include her overcoming some type of bullying. It will be chock full of girl power cliches that will probably be more insulting than empowering. I see it doing far less than Wonder Woman.
1:30 when your grandma don't give you cookies
How old is Carol Danvers?
Did anyone laugh when she punched an old lady face?
Captain Marvel: "No, but I would punch an evil old hag."
This looks liek women in black capeshit edition
i smell sooooo many memes coming from captain marvel punching that granny lol
the question is who and why did she punch that old lady lmao
Everyone is talking about the old lady
Well shit
That feeling when it's there maybe one day and it almost have views like 3 months old Shazam!
Trailer not good. It's like poop and shit together.
And when the Thanos snap happened, Captain Marvel said that it she saw it in her "flashes", and told Nick to call her when it happens. And Captain Marvel has been training for decades to avenge the world where she lost.
Thanos be like, ooooh shit!
Probably won't go see it in theaters, but I may rent it eventually just to see why she punched that lil old lady's face off.
I feel like the old lady deserved it 😂 ...only time will tell
Are there any roles played by men in realistic parts (you know like fighter pilots, maintenance workers, etc) in the movie or is it all given over to the rubbery feminist rhetoric being forced fed to the gullible in the mainstream world of delusion and lies as fact....???  Looks like shite to me...... another blurring of the sexes to push the transhumanism agenda and all of the other trappings too...
How can we tell that was a skrull and not a innocent old lady
Some of the tralier is cool however as a whole it was a bit unimpressive and underwhelming... hoping that Marvel don't go all feminist on us, it's cool that she's a girl but don't beat it into us! We get it and it doesn't need to be mentioned in the film. But lastly I do have faith in Marvel so I hope it is great and it probably will be! They do seem to be the one movie Company that never really has a film of there's flop! It's exciting to see where Marvel is going to go from here when it comes to new characters and it being the 10th anniversary but will be sad saying goodbye to the old characters.. sucks that there won't be more thor, Iron Man and cap!
1:30 When your grandma doesn't cook
1:22 holy shit is that jude law?
1:31 ABUSIVE 1 like =1 heart for grandma
No offense right. But this is the first ever Marvel movie I'm not looking forward too. I just don't like Captain Marvel. She could hv been easily replaced with someone else. Reply if u hv any suggestions on who. Also I hate that she will probably come in and kick the shit out of Thanos on like 5 minutes. Also if you read the comics Thanos has been known to just one shot her. Without the Infinity Stones. Then again I am still seeing it and am willing to eat my words if it is a good movie
in this movie isn't nick fury younger, but in infinity war he is old. So does that mean Captain marvel is going to be a grandma?????
That old lady is obviously....not an old lady. Captain Marvel knows what's up.
In Soviet Russia, grandma punch you
Old lady=Teen Titans Go
1:30 first i was like Boi wtf she punching old ladies then boom i realized its a skrull
Wasn’t a good thrailer tbh. She hitting that grandma was pretty funny though. Samuel L. Jackson was pretty cool as always. I’m excited to see the movie but this thrailer was bad comparing it to other Marvel thrailer. Here before 20m!!
This commercial is gonna get controversial, but only because she punched an Old Woman without explaining her being a Skrull 😂
Holy fkin shit i am hyped rn
When my Grandma tries to pinch my cheeks 1:20
Tbh I didn’t fully pay attention till she threw that hook to the old lady 😂
I'm done with DC till they get their shit together
grandma wants you to thank the bus driver
Infinity war has ruined the MCU. Now everyone wants big bad crossovers with moar explosions and shit
Basically just a backstory and another "don't underestimate me because I'm a woman" shit
She barely shows any emotion... Oh yes i forgot, even in comics Carl Manvers has no emotion, just this punchable face because of her dull personality.
At some point in time movies hit a peak this is the down hill part of Cinema for the next few years.
She jooked the old lady narsty 👊
I've never wanted to punch a old lady in the mouth in all my life than I do now. 1st old lady with glasses I see is going to get decked in the mouth.
The very same Brie Larson who publicly hates on white men. Return the favour fellow white men - and don't go watch it. Money is the only language they understand.
if u confuse ,the grandma scene is the part of skrull abilities :v
Mfw I saw the Blockbuster... did you know Blockbuster’s CEO passed up the chance to buy NETFLIX for $50 Mill, I may be confusing 2 things together but I’m pretty sure he laughed in the creator(s?) face and told him it was a stupid Idea.
Our hero. Punching an old lady for smiling.
Like to punch the grandma!
Who's dat grandma???
captain marvel: "hold my beer"
After 1:31: or just not. Just punch them I guess
*captain marvel punches an old woman*
So, I keep hearing that people aren't impressed with this trailer. I call it bullshit.
Damn. She just straight up punched that old lady on the subway. Captain Marvel is hardcore
Don’t punch your elderly wait that’s a freakin skull keep on
CalebCity better watch out. Captain Marvel punching grandmas out here.
I know that old lady was a Skrull but I'm weak😂😂😂😭💀 she broke her face bud👊
Lol punched an old lady
Did she just punch an old lady in the FACE???
Grandma : i'm a vegan
For every like and view in the trailer, I get older by one year.
Ammmm why did she punch the old lady????
Hope that the old lady was a skrull
Did Captain Marvel just punched an old lady.
Why did she just punch that lady
So are we all going to ignore the fact that she punches an old lady in the face???
Holy shit mace windu is alive
*proceeds to punch grandma in the head* 😂
Lmao poor grandma!!!!
1Like=1RIP for that old lady ...
At 1:31 I think she knocked the dentures out that old lady mouth
calebcity told me about this *grandma punching* mfr
This movie looks like a load of dogshit. My expectations where way too high for this. Another genric alien invasion movie with some bimbo nobody cares about.
Shit... I'm dead,there's no way i can beat Captain Marvel
She slapped a grandma, she definitely defeating thanos now...
What happen to that granny? 😭
So.. She is thw one whos honna kick the shit out of thanos...
This is a pig who begs for likes. They’re 0 years old and they’re unoriginal.
I seriously don't like Ms. Marvel and the only reason is that after all the marvel movies and 15-18 superheroes this white a7$% suddenly comes and try to credit as the biggest superhero in the whole marvel universe by confronting Thanos. How do you feel if voldemort is killed by other than harry potter ?
Okay but why she punch that old lady??
I think I'm officially getting old. From watching all the Marvel movies to being very hyped to watch their first show, this does nothing more than just seeing what she looks like. And i love Brie and Gemma and all but the marvel formula is wearing off on me
Wonder Woman > Whatever bullshit this is
Supersonic Megashit
It is going to be some feminist bullshit 
The grandma is Loki
Save yourselves reading asinine comments. DISCLAIMER: The old lady, is a Skrull!
Why does Captain Marvel sound like a 12 year old girl... Terribly cast.
the best part of the trailer is that when she punches crap out of that old lady ........
Felt nothing watching this dumb shit...
Thumbs up for punching an old lady.
1:31 When Grandma is riding the subway and Captain Marvel walks up and punches her....
How does nick fury look more old in the past
Bullshit Bullshit
1:31 that old lady has a severe case of down syndrome
Did she hit Aunt May ?
sam old super hero crap.. whats new??
Im sorry but every time she punches that old lady 😂😂 im a terribale person
okay but why did she slap an old lady?
When ur grandma doesn't make you cookies 1:31
this shit boutta break the internet
Holy shit its here!!
That name was probably made a a granny that doesn’t now anything about marvel
Feminism does not make good movies. Star Wars, Ocean's Eight or Mary Sue Star Wars or even Ghostbusters nobody wanted. Looks like all other superhero movies directed at 13 year old audience. There are no good movies with no grit.
I can't wait for this and lmao a block buster I feel old because I remember it
Was the old lady a skrull ?
punching old ladies since 1990
Ok but did she just punch an old lady?
Before some fanboys decide to jump the shark, I'm going to write what I wrote before they released Black Panther.  This is a super hero movie.  Not a feminist movie (or a Black movie).  It's a movie movie.  Keep the judgments to a minimum until the next trailer at least.  Secondly, this is the first official trailer.  Treat it as the teaser that it actually is.  It's not going to look awesome (although, it kinda does) Thirdly, she punched a grandma (and if you didn't know it already, there are Skrulls in this movie, look that stuff up), so best believe she has no problems punching anyone, male or female. Finally, this is a Marvel movie.  They tend not to suck, so prepare to be pleasantly surprised.  Unless, of course, you are a DC hater.  Henry Cavill has proved that he is not the problem....
feminist are going 😂 to get mad if this movie turn out bad "its all b3cause of white straight man".
oh, shit! thanos must have seen it
“Truth be told I was ready to hang it up till I met you today” hang it up man. Hang it up.
Yo that old lady punch caught me off guard😂😂
When Captain Marvel Slaps Old Woman.She didn't move even from seats with her being Powerful. Means She can sense Skrull between Humans.
i'm so confused, why did she punch the old woman?
You gotta be shitting me...
that poor old woman > thanos
No grandma I won’t eat your damn vegetables!
1 like = 1 pray for Grandma
Wait hold on a second, if she's from the 90s, how is it that she's putting on a voice like the kardashians or summin, no one spoke like that back then, it's totally put on and sounds cheesy as hell, talk like a real woman ffs, not a little girl, was gassed about this movie, now I kinda see who they're making this for, fake 2018 little girls, what happened to strong women?
Captain Marvel is guna kick grandma ass
Holy shit just holy shit
Grandma: I washed your Laptop,
Covered neck to toe in leather... Hold one one god dang minute... Some feminists are pro flesh... Its all empowerment girls... And then some women are like... Cover everything up girls (bit Muslim if you ask me) dont let those evil males get their grimy eyes on you or they will objectify you... Oh god dread the thought.... Make your mind up ladies. BTW, this covered muslim capt. Marvel looks shit... They should have found a director with the balls and an actress with the self confidence (sorry, not any of those fatties) to show some leg.... Man this film looks shit.
At first I hated Captain Marvel cuz the pinched an old lady...
A buddy movie with Nick Fury is awesome. So is that part where she hit the old lady.. so was blockbuster.
I hope she punches Thanos the same way she punched that old lady!
Watching this made me remember that being rich, European white male is awesome and may God grant diligence and patience to everything else.
ok I'm interested but one question.... "why did you punch the old lady?"
That's one shitty trailer. C'mon, marvel, get me hyped!
I know everyone is mad because Captain Marvel hit grandma but just be glad that she went for the head
I know that it was a skrull, But that grandma slap shook me😂
Captain marvel is hitting the old lady
I think it looks shit to be honest......
This shits gonna rock
Super hit and 1st comment
What makes a hero? Smack an old woman in public. LOL WTF
Punching senior citizens isn’t something I consider when watching a Marvel movie. 1:31 But this... did put a smile on my face.
BTW:  Play this without sound.  It may be the most ridiculous thing ever.  This actress has the most generic white female look yet in an action  movie.
The same shit we see ever year but with a new gimmick thrown in
So, punched an old lady on the bus today. Didn't got superpowers, what do?
She hitted the old woman in the bus
She smacked tf out that old lady ! 😂
Gonna be a huge hit
You know real shit is about to go down when a character's eyes start to glow up
Damn, she *socked* that old lady o__o
Does nothing heroic + Punches a smiling old lady out of context = Hero
I think that this one will be no hit in the box office 🧐
I love female superheroes. That's why i'll watch Wonder Woman 84.  Not this boring shit.
*old lady take the sit and just smile(without thank)
Yeah grandma punching superheroes are a bit too far
Captain Marvel punches the old lady
Punched old lady in the face 10/10; I liked the fairly accurate portrayal of Carol Danver's origin. But the punch nailed it for me.
Did she just punch an old lady ? .. I wish she punched thanos
1:31 When ur grandma tells you to go to bed early.
Calling it, grandma getting punched is the new meme of the month
So, This Movie Shows The Part Of When Did Nick Fury First Met Captain Marvel, I Mean I DID Saw The Post Credit In Infinity War But This, This Is Actually Good But Truth Be Told The Grandma Part, Im Not Even Sure If She IS Human Or Something I Just Think That From What I Saw There, There Would Be Shapeshifters But Im Not Sure If Karol (Captain Marvel) Really Punched A Human Old Woman
Punched the shit out that old lady 😂😂😂
“Let’s see what there is to hate/shit on, that should give me a bunch of likes”
Hold my popcorn🍿😭😭😭😭
I think that grandma is Thanos mother
What? No modern pop songs or reveals of 80% of the plot? What a shit trailer.
So the grandma is a skrull 🤔
She punched the shit out of that old lady
This looks shite
Wake up call, get out of satan system and get in God system before it's too late, get a tru loving relationship with God not a false fake satanic Roman Catholic Church religion, people claim they love God but lifestyle heart mind mouth and soul says satan and hell but I'm not talking about America god which is satan literally just study the symbols and signs on the back of your dollar starting with the all seeing eye pyramid of Lucifer, check out Dana Stevens : white church most wake up your enslaving god chosen, on YouTube this is a white man telling truth ⏳
What if that Grandma isn't a Skrull but an actual Grandma? Lol.😂
Granny: 1:31 why would you hit an old lady
omg she punched an old lady, i gotta watch this :D
So are we just gonna ignore the fact that an old lady gets knocked out in this?
Thanos be in deep shit now, he be
*Smacks Old lady*
thanos ganna hire that grandma
1:30 when grandma forgets the cookies in the oven
*punches old woman in the face*
Grandma: Fortnite is better than PUBG
Did Marvel missed Ryan Reynolds's joke: DON'T MAKE MY SUPER SUIT GREEN... OR ANIMATED!! ???
Look boring,why Marvel actresses all look old?Lily Collins or Teresa Palmer should take up the role,they are more beautiful.Wonder Woman is popular because Gal Gadot is good looking.
Captain Marvel punches a elder woman (which may or may not be an actual Villain)
1:31 when your grandma 👵 doesn’t want to make you cookies 🍪....
this girl is shit.
Her acting is shitty I predict flop
1:39 If this do not prove that Batman would totally work with the light lenses/white eyes in Live Action movies, I don't know what will do.
Grandma: *smiles*
Shit.....I am crying.....plz .... schedule the release date sooner....
waiting for the grandma memes
Edit: I hope she isn't too OP, though. That would make it a pretty shitty movie.
I punched a man today.. went to jail xD
All this woman hero shit!
first, before it hits trending
Ik there’s gonna be a reason for this, but the fact that she slapped the shit outta the grandma is hilarious
That old lady she punched is loki disquised
Came for Captain Marvel. Stayed for when she smacked that old lady.
Did anyone see captain marvel punch a old lady
The old laby is skull 
Wanna get likes, comment about captain hitting the old lady 1:30.. Now, give me mine.😁😁
why she even hit poor granny
The skrulls still looks shit ffs I hate this
In the minute 1:34 where he shows that apparatus with the inscription '' with target '', in the movie Avengers Infinity War, in the finale when everyone has been melting ', the same character (the black) before disappearing too, shows the same apparatus that small, and there is written "ENTER" , voldire that in the Avengers Infinity War 2, will also Captain Marvel, look at you too and you'll see that I'm right!
Aaaand she punched an old lady....oh oh so it is ok for a woman to punch another woman...I see how it works now
80% of the comments are about the grandma
This movie needs more old ladies getting punched!
1:30 The Grandma from Tanos
1:34 PAGER!!! OMG...why do I feel so old now T_T
Me: I was just here to see old comments on Wonder Woman saying it would be bad and then making them wrong
1:30 when grandma starts being racist again
WOW! this looks so bad and uninteresting..... I know nothing about Captain Marvel and this trailer did not interest me at all. The only good part was when that old lady got punched.
This shit is badass
I just hate that catching up shit with the timeline. Other than that it should be another winner
I don't understand why people are overhyping this. A character we ain't seen before and punches an old lady?!?! This won't be that good
That old lady was channeling Rosa Parks. Lol
Wolverine should show up and they could have old school team up
The coat check girl from Greendale! Sold.
Did she just punch that old lady in the face 😂😭
1:30 when your grandma gets you the wrong gift 5 years in a row
i didn't get why marvel tries to be involved any kinda feminism shit.. even if i don't know what kinda message they're going to give...
Wait first haven’t seen a block buster in years and why she hit that grandma
I like it but her voice sounds like one of those white girl thots at the gym..just saying
Did she punch a grandma?
Punches a smiling old granny in the face.
Um, this looks shit.
It's gonna be awkward when that old lady turns out to be just an old lady and not a Skrull.
Alright, I'm sold on punching a granny already.
Marvel: She'll punch a Grandma.
This looks terrible. Her acting is shite. She is in no way intimidating or cool. Compare her to every other marvel hero in the avengers and she is by far the worst. I've seen most marvel films in the cinema but i am definitely not paying for this shite. This film is going to do badly and Marvel deserves it for bowing down to the feminists.
61k people got their grandma punched in the face because of 1 too many farts she did on that bus
Feminist bullshit
ehi this is uninclusive: I want a captain grandma
Grandma: Are you Green Lantern?
hit like for Captain Marvel
She punched an old lady haha LOL
Does Marvel really want to show an old lady getting punched. Especially with looney copycats out there? Other than that, the film looks promising.
Captain Marvel, punching grandmas since the 90s
Marvel has sold out to Blockbuster!!!
If this is som feminazi shit im gonna skip this movie
This is the decline of Marvel. The only reason this cinematic universe exists is that Marvel took the shit-tier hero Iron Man and accidentally gave him a lot of personality and a really great original movie. They lost their touch, and the Marvel Universe will slowly decline if they continue this path.
This shit wanna fight Tanos?
Did she just punch an old lady? 😂
Fan made videos were way much better than this shitty trailer
*Punches old lady* 
ok but why did she punch that old woman in the face
Avengers fans hit like 😎😎🎉👌
When grandma sends you socks for Christmas 1:30
I'm not ignoring the fact that there is a granny being punch for seemingly no reason...I know...she's probably a bad guy in disguise...but out of context, it's just a superhero punching the elderly.
Did the captain hit an old lady
The old lady is Thanos
So I'm assuming that old lady was a Scrull
the old ledy at 1:30 is skrull 
10 Seconds in and viewers can spot Blockbuster vidros, must be old.
Maybe the old lady she punched is a SKRULL?!???!!!??!?!!?
Maybe the old lady was Kree
Why did she just smack the soul out of that poor grandma?
Her: Punches Old Lady
Grandma punch: When the old people drive slow in the fast lane.
This should have been an Adam Warlock trailer. It would have made more sense. Now we're stuck with this shitty failed character from the comics because 'Girl Power!' I guess
I think that Captain Marvel is from the old years and I think at Avengers 4 where Iron Man will time travel he will meet Captain Marvel from the old years
bwahahah looks so shit like all other marvel films
When they told you to give your grandmother a seat
When your granny didn’t mail you $5 on your birthday
plot twist: that old lady is thanos's grandma
Old Lady: Dang, girl... where is your booty?
Seriously? We bring in a black hero, then a female hero? Smh, society today is bonkers. Stick to white and male protagonists.
Boy it was funny to watch her punch that old woman. No context, or explanation. Just her beating an old woman. Nice job.
its ok to be white
They should of made punching the old
Captain marvel, who is stronger me or Batman. Old lady, Batman. Captain marvel, punches the shit out of her
Another movie about a superhero/ pretty white gal.  The real race card.
For y'all wondering why she punched the elderly, the old lady is a Skrull, which are shapeshifting aliens that can imitate your memories and even your powers but will go back to regular form when hurt
The old lady had it coming.
*Punches old woman in the face*
That old lady is Trumps mom. Capt Marvel goes back into time and beats the shit outta her.
Marvel: we could literally show a hero punching an old lady in the face, destroying a Blockbuster, using a pager, and people will applaud us!
 One more Super hit on the way in 2019
ME: people are just saying that cuz they dont know shit about carol denvers.. Also marvel fans are shitting on marvel now? Comes full circle aint it?
Surprise the old ladies teeth didn't fall out lol
guys pretty sure the old lady is a Skrull??? Alien Invasion???
1:30 "Give me your seat, old lady!"
Why does she look like she has too shit through this whole trailer.
Blockbuster video was my spot growing up damn I'm old lmao
Bus Grandma's are the worst
48,000 people disliked when she hit grandma
At 1:28 She Punches An Old Lady Because She Is A Skrull Only Real Marvel Fans Know That But It's Still Cool Seeing A Superhero Punch An Elderly
He look, an old lady
1:33 oh shit its Ronan
P.S. pretend that old lady is Thanos
highkey feel like everyone is shitting on this trailer just because its a female lead but,, none of my business 🤷🏼‍♀️
The old lady was a skull for the idiots out there
this movie is for kids under 9 years old only deal with it booooooring
1:31 y did she hit that old women 
Is Captain Marvel's power supposed to be the ability to hold one facial expression 24/7?
I love the part where she punches the grandma
At last marvel has started making some shit!!
90% of comments - she punched grandma
What !!! Bullshit
1:31 when your grandma tells you there’s food at home.
Did Captain Marbel just hit an old women?
Looks like someone has mashed up a load of shit and tried to sculpt it into something then said that'll do
Same old marvel movie looks shitty
More shite from Marvel. Please stop. Strong females trying to be like men, it doesn't work. Try something original. Ripley from Aliens....great character
Holy shit you people need to chill out. This is just the first trailer there's definitely going to be more trailers improving on this one. we still have months before the actual movie comes out until then I'm pretty sure they're going to approve the CGI or other stuff just give it some time.
1:31 when you find out your grandma voted for me
Aww nice old lady 👵!
Hit like if you waiting for this
Hey do u really think cap marvel is gonna defeat Thanos. Hit like if u support.
Dont you even noticed that avenger series is becoming boring. Its like shitty funny to me that captain marvel is strongest.  -Thanos💩
1:30 when ur granny keeps asking u for shit.
Stan, you will *never* be forgotten. So long old friend.
The old lady took her seat at the train thats why she punched her. Old people should stand up and give their seats to superheroes
shiteeeeeeeeeeeeeee
SHE punched a women is SHE a villan
Issa no go on that granny punch
‘Punches old lady memes’ incoming
Please - ... big shot trailer folks - this stuff is shit!!
this trailer was shit it didn't hype me as much but i hope the movie is good especially cause it is MCU first female led superhero movie if that comes out well it will be a game changer for marvel. So marvel please make the next trailer good!
Marvel this time it a shit.
Who saw it before it hits trending!
Why did she punch the Grandma?
There are several comments here by people claiming to have read "all the marvel comics" and that there was never a female Capt Marvel... I mean....She first appeared in Marvel Super-Heroes #13 wayyyy back in the day (1960s/70s??) - I only remember some of those older editions by number because my uncle was a collector and he only let us touch certain books; #13 was one of them :)
Rip that old woman
Loved when she punched the old lady
R.I.P. Random Grandma
Black widow: I'm done with this shit
It's sooo painful watching her punch the old lady. I can't take it.
looks a little too cheesy... come on guys!!!! u can do better than using old star trek costumes!
She hit an old lady ☠
she just hit a old woman
Punch grandmas in the face.
Thanos cant hit women because he's a real gentleman
The poor old lady
I heard that she is wearing green cause for some reason in this movie she was married to a guy who was a green latern and stole his ring for a day and was given half the powers of a green Latern so now she lets her husband and his group fight the big threats and she focuses on the little crimes like old ladies who J walk to get to the bus stop.
she shold be black like ciri
That poor grandma got hit in the face
They have to make a back story about her first then make her a huge factor in the avengers infinity war part 2 that's why this looks really shitty, but it would be more shitty if they just did part 2 without any background at all imo
watching this trailer make me realize that i know shit about captain marvel, so it is off t wikipedia.
50% why she punched the old lady
Hmm idk. The whole timeline seems to be messed up. I have no problem with her though, just have a feeling the story and how it fits into the Mcu will be shit
Old lady : still wonder woman you mug 1:30
Why does she hit the old woman tho?
Oh shitttttt Superman whoo
old lady exploded rip
Punching an old woman, some hero..............*sarcasm*
Captain Marvel: *punches* GIVE ME MY COOKIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
will get the same fate as Solo the star shit story
Why at 1:30 does she punch the old woman
Edit: I know shes not an actual old woman
I liked the video but truth be told, it looks kinda boring to me
Şehitler ölmez vata❤ 
Oh shit this is cool
Y she beated poor grandma😕😕
*Damn that old granny*
She hit the old lady because she was a skull. And this trailer is just a teaser. The movie is yet to come the next year. You cannot judge a film by its teaser
Granny: Hello sweet pea.
I’ve never felt more dated as a twenty year old then when I saw that blockbuster store she landed in
Holy shit it looks so good
Young Nick Fury, Young (complete hair) Phil Coulson, an Amnesia Captain Marvel, and an old lady disguised skrull gets punched. Kinda like a teaser for the real deal, then again it is the first trailer
Nick Fury, Agent Coulson, and Skrulls? I’m in...shut up and take my money. I also think this was a  “fake out” trailer. No jokes or one liners from any of the actors...aside from punching grandma:
LOVE THE TRAILER!!!! but poor granny :(
When grandma says that Batman died in Infinity War...
Ahh I see  thats why nick fury in last part in avenger movie. He hold that device  calling the Captain marvel.
Marvel: Hold my beer.
Who the hell puts a non-contextual-old-lady-hitting scene in a superhero trailer????
Thanos gonna sense this and be shitting his pants now😐😆
Grandma-"I don't feel so good"
Punch an old lady? Yo, I'm hooked.
you punch politely right on through
Well let’s take a moment. This is only really a teaser trailer. So it does “tease” and make you ask questions and want more. You gotta love landing in a Blockbuster to set it up in the 90s. It makes you want to know more about her origins and powers and relationship with Fury. And you have to think she must be quite a bad-ass because when the shit really hit the fan, Nick Fury messaged her at the end of Infinity War (sorry spoiler but if you haven’t seen it what’s wrong with you). So the universe is being destroyed and people are literally disappearing from existence and the person you need the most is Captain Marvel, than she might have something to offer. I would sum this trailer up as “hopeful potential”. Plus has Marvel steered us wrong yet overall? Or Kevin Feige ? Let’s hold tight and trust them for now. Plus it’s just a movie folks, relax and enjoy.
Old lady was probably a Kree.
Excited but also super cautious about his movie because Brie Larson looks kind of like she’s sleep walking through the role and sometimes as an actress she is hit or miss.
I need to watch this movie because the media have not told me how strong women and men are weak, for almost a whole 5 minutes.
So much for the "World's Greatest Grandma."
Did she just punched an Old nice lady?
Too much candies ... In your face granny.
Best part of the trailer, when she punches an old lady that is definitely not a Skrull. Also RIP Blockbuster.
Most comments are about the old lady being punched. The old lady is most likely a shape shifter, idiots.
Everyone talking about the grandma but no one is mentioning BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO!!!!!
feminist bullshit
So how old will Stan lee be in this cameo...?
She just punched an old lady. Whaaaaa
Thor fans hit like
I don’t understand why people have a problem with Captain Marvel being end-game for Thanos. No one had an issue with Jean Grey being the most powerful. In Apocalypse she nearly single-handedly took him out. I think CM’s power progression will probably be like Jean Grey’s where she was forced to hold back, but gradually discovers who she is. I also think the trailer may have intentionally made her look weak and ordinary as a part of the slow build theme. Lots of shots of her falling (from the opening scene to the last) and getting back up.
Hits old woman with great force
Feeling sorry for that old lady
What Makes Her a Hero...Punched an Old Lady lmao
I bet the actor of the grandma is hurt probably
Bruhhh she wrecked that Grandma
Hitting old ass ladies is not what we need to be teaching these kids Marvel otta be ashamed of themselves
punches an old lady. totally down to watch now.
Like for grandma 
11k are those 9/10 year olds
The first seen was marketing, this is low , I expected more from marvel. I still have no idea who the villains are, the only act of violence I saw was Captain Marvel bunching an old lady.
So we have to wait to watch why a Marvel  heroine hit an old lady ..
Would you punch a granny for one billio...
Hit likes who r waiting 4 INFINITY WAR 2
That's my girl Carol! This movie better not suck. Fox Films already ruined my other two favorite comic book characters with their shitty representations of Psylocke and Emma Frost. Don't let me down.
Why she hit the old lady?😟
Umm how is an old woman a threat?
1:30 when your grandma says dc is better than marvel
Captain marvel is a large strong man. Wtf is this shit ???? Captian hips?
Captain Wamen: White Savior?
From what I remember Brie Larson was pretty weak in Kong Skull Island. I'm not expecting too much from this film. We haven't even been introduced to a villain yet (except the grandma, rip)
Yooo why did Captain Marvel punch that old lady like that I’m screaming
She just totals this old lady🤣
holy shit that was awesome
When she hit that grandma 
hero she hit the old lady
Y'all obsessing over CM punching an old lady need to remember that one time Jessica Jones knocked an old lady to the floor and started beating on her with a ripped-off pipe.
this only looks shit because everyone's seeing this after they've seen infinity war, which had an amazing trailer
What did the old lady do to her 😂
1:31 when I’m at my grandmas and she tells me too buy her some milk
Why did the old lady get punched..I don’t think that was a necessary clip to add to the 
This was a shitty trailer but I’m still very excited!!!! Can’t wait
Brie Larson or whatever looks and talks like a robot, and the effects look passable. To be honest though I'm really excited for the skrulls in this movie. Their ability of shape-shifting was perfectly shown off in her punching an old lady, and I can't wait to see more of it. Good on ya marvel movies for taking one of the most awful superheroes you've made in the last decade or so and maybe making her a good movie.
Summary: She punches some old woman on the subway and then proceeds to turn into a Halloween pumpkin
That old lady was thanos mother.
Apparently punching old smiling ladies in the face makes someone a hero lmao
Yooo she blasted that old broad in the face lmaooo
Punches old lady
I think that old lady is a skrull
Did you know a feminist blogger got mad because Fury had more words to say in this trailer then Carol? I honestly think that’s just bullshit.
awesome!  i had a feeling that 1st suit was just a beginner for when she 1st was a pilot of sorts and got involved with some crazy.    people need to calm down on that stuff when a movie 1st comes out.   in the last few seconds they had her usual red blue and gold look so now everyone can be happy
The skrulls are the hero’s and captain marvel is the villain, she punched an old woman in the face!
Shit they actually made the trailer. Can’t wait for avengers infinity war part 2 trailer :D
Damn this looks bad! Like, straight-to-DVD bad. Right into the shit pile of B-movies in Block Buster with this one... wait
People do realize that this is the first trailer so it’s basically a teaser. Calm your shit.
....Why the hell did she snuff an old lady?...
Why the Grandma ?
Legend says she's gonna beat thanos but she's beating up old people
For everybody complaining bout this trailer saying she don’t have no expression she looks bored if you are a real captain marvel fan you know this lady is not somebody who smiles a lot she gets shit done she’s a leader I’m pretty sure in this movie yea they are going to have funny parts but this trailer was good to me it doesn’t show to much to give off what she can do its MARVEL PPL THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING TRUST ME THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO BE EPIC
1:30  Grandma: Steve Rogers was a fine dime in WW2, he still is and you call yourself a Captain... 
Where is Ryan Reynolds?
1:30 When grandma gets the cookies but forgets the milk.
miss casting...she doesnt looks like a hero. Just  like a crier single mom. Shit
Captain marvel: *punches face"
You had me at old lady punch
This movie looks like a load of complete shit like 99% of Hollywood the past 10 years
"She looks bored and doesn't show enough emotion..." = Every douchebag ever who has told girls/women they should, "smile more".
Did she punch a grandma on a bus as hard as she could 😂
"Warning: valid proof of fare payment must be in your possession at all time!" Can't say granny wasn't warned...
That poor Old lady! who is this terrible person??
Hit like for caption marvel 😍
Plot twist: the old lady isn't a skrull
*beats an old woman*
I'll be honest, the granny punching is the only thing that got a reaction out of me in this trailer, kinda boring really. Also **ALERT** if you disagree that this is an amazing trailer in any way you will have Marvel fans jumping down your neck calling you a jealous DC fan, that's just my observation of the comment section ;)
ik im not the only one who lost my shit when she had on her war helmet OMMGGGGGGGGGG
This movie's theme of "war on the elderly" is a bold move; I'll admit, I am intrigued. (Kindly don't bother "nerd-splaining" what the old woman LIKELY is; I sincerely don't care, and the war-on-the-elderly theme would ONLY SAVE THIS MOVIE.)
Grandma: Despacito is better than Despacito 2 
Look like a shit
mmmm am I the only one who feels like they definitely could’ve cast a better female actress in this role? Maybe even an unknown up and coming actress? Bri Larson just looks so off. She’s not an action hero and (I know imma get shit for this) isn’t built like one either. The folks at Marvel made Paul Rudd work to get a six pack n he’s pushing 50, hell they made Chris Pratt completely flip his life around from being borderline obese to a muscle beast annnnnd Bri doesn’t even look like she jogged for this role. Kind of a let down. Aside from physicality people just don’t embody an action hero, and she’s one of them. You can’t make an actress be good at playing action hero by slapping a dumbass costume on them, they have to actually fit. Just like Steve Buscemi was never cast for a superhero role, neither should Bri Larson have.
We know that old woman was a Skrull she was punching.. but we also know it was put there for the "down with the old" agenda.
Grandmaaa nooo...
More movies need old ladies being punched in the face.
Like for captain marvel punching old lady on the bus
Save yourselves reading asinine comments. DISCLAIMER: The old lady, is a skrull.
movie looks shit
oh shit marvel got a power up
She just beat the shit out of grandma
1:30 5 year old niggas when they open a cookie box at their grandma's house and all it has it in are sewing materials
1:31 Did she just punch my Gran Ma 🤧🤯
Nick Fury looks old though …
Maybe the old lady was a skrull.
*Captain Marvel- hits an old lady*
Why did she punch that old woman
Plot twist: grandma is Thanos
Is it just me or hitting an old lady after she takes your seat on the bus is kinda heroic... oh, so just me? Okay...
I saw the Blockbuster and felt old. Looks good, hope it's good. Loved seeing her mask with the mohawk
Grandma: here’s some cookies
This is the shit
Jesus that costume looks like shit
0:06 Good old Blockbuster Video. Those were the days!
Oh shit!  Its about to go down!
Damn Captain Marvel, slapping the shit out of my grandma. LOL I stan
Ya'll...I cant wait. I am sold! Under 500 k team :)
Ronan the accuser is going to be in this too. I just shit myself
The one thing I liked was when she punched a grandma in the face.
*What has that grandma done to you?*
1:30 Why did she punch MARTHA??!!
Thugs of Captain Marvel... Old lady was smashed... 😎🚬
Captain marvel taught me to slap old women on the bus for no reason
she punch da ol d lady
Calling it now you heard it hear first, when everyone is doing their binge watch of all the MCU movies before Avengers 4, this will be the movie people groan about and only want to watch because it holds important knowledge.
Looks like a a dc movie with a touch of marvel love how she became a hero by punching an old lady amazing script who ever wrote it
Uhhhhh ..... holy shit?
show the old lady in slower motion. puuuuuuuuuuuuuuunch!
*slaps an old woman*
Holy shit yes!!!
I'm gonna watch this movie just to see her punch an old lady.
Plot twist: grandma is thanos
Imagine how much butthurt would be if cpt marvel would be a man and punch that old woman...
Wtf! She just hit the old lady!!!
Soo slaps a old lady ??
"I don't want to hear what a white man has to say..."-Brie Larson
"Punches an old lady"
_Discover what makes a hero_ *proceeds to punch an elderly woman the second right after*
Punching grandma=new god tier Meme
Blockbusters? How old is she?
I didn't know captain marvel was a live in caregiver the way she handled that old lady
That poor old lady was a skrull
Everyone in the comments about her punching an old lady, apparently don’t realize that Skrul (sp?) are shapeshifters.
I miss her old costume.
Throughout the film Nick and maybe Phil helps Carol remember her connection to Earth and who she was before the accident and the Kree did the Winter Soldier thing on her memory. Eventually Starforce come for her and try to take her back to Hala, but Carol is now aware of what they did to her and let's just say that she isn't happy....
You know what really sucks? Is the fact she's actually a badass character in the comics and has been out since forever and they're going to "antman" her...folks really think she was just made up or doesn't have her own comics when she's been around doing damage....it's not about a "girl power thing"...her storyline was definitely a key point in infinity war...but it wont work for how they told this infinity war in the mcu...they definitely are going to butcher her story cause this trailer was a fail... and im sorry It was a no with brie since they announced it was going to be her and it looks like I was right about that...I love marvel...but this...they know better...especially cause it's so close to the end...no time for this movie to be just another filler movie...
1 second later she punch a granny..  ._________.
Did she just punch an old women?
*Guys!*  Captain Marvel punched that lady because she refused to give her candy!  It’s all coming together now! 
1.30, when your grandma.... please continue
Not a DC hater but trust me this will make Wonder Woman look like shit.
R.I.P the old lady!
*_Rip Grandma_* 
meh actress. Yawn. Also encouraging people to punch old folks is NOT cool. Just more degeneration of our very sick society.
If the grandma never had a child, is she still a grandma?
Y'all realise that if it was an actual old lady Marvel punched her head would have vapourized on impact. The "old lady" is clearly not human.
Captain Marvel's character being BY DEFINITION one of the most powerful super beings in the Universe, I'm hoping this doesn't become a mirror in the treatment of how Superman is for the DC universe. The God Hero being shit is just borderline lazy writing to me and obnoxious. No offense to DC fans. 
The way she popped that old lady thoo..
Is that the Winter Soldier at 1:43?
I love Marvel trailers, Stan Lee cameos, and old ladies getting punched straight in the face.
So we have a grandma being punched meme now, huh?
crashing into a blockbuster... man i miss those stores. why is everyone so damn skeptical in the comments? damn it was 1:56 trailer ... also that old lady had it comin... im jussayin lmfao
Thanos: “huh....... shit”
INSTANT DISLIKE 👎 This movie will start the downfall of Marvel Universe !!!!! SO thankful all that of  shitty mother box, infinity stone, superhero shit will finally end and we will again have great movies like Chinatown, Shawshank redemption, One flew over the cuckoos nest , godfather etc etc ALSO THE MOVIE LOOKS LIKE A CHEAP TV SHOW !!! Hope it flops
She just wacked a grandma in the face
1:30 when grandma embarrasses you when your friends are over💀💀💀
The scene where she punched the old lady right in the face tho.....Looks like it hurts
Şehitler ölmez vatan bölünmez❤
holly shit this is going blast in 2019
The part that made me laugh was when she punched the old lady.
The old lady was probably a Skrull...
“We have know idea what threats are out there” punches a old lady
When she punched the lady I was like “OMGGGGG”😂😂😂 but I realized “oh yeah there are skrulls in this movie😂😂😂
Remember guys, marvel studios always gets the box office gold
I can feel the Grandma punch turning into a meme🤷🏾‍♂️😏
shit I can't watch this I'm having a orgasm right now
That lady just took that punch like a champ
When the bus driver you just thanked makes you give up your seat for an old lady
After seeing her punch the lady who is most likely a skrull, what if Avengers 4 ended like this:
1:31 Lol get wrecked grandma
And, now: Here's Phase 4 comin' up! Strange seeing Nick Fury all youngish, w/ a full head of hair, and no eye patch. Agent Phil Coulson, probably a level 3 or 4 at this time, looks cool. I LOVE the fact that this tale will be told in reverse/flashback-style, rather than the now-typical, word-for-word "origin story" template. I'm interested. I've been thinking that Robert Redford should have a cameo in this film. I really hope Peggy Carter has a minor role in the story, as well. Well, Marvel, it's gonna be quite a feat to top Infinity War, but, I have a feeling you just might do it. Kevin Feige, We love you!
Grandma got decked
We punchin old ladies now ????
Don't worry guys, the grandma was just a Skrull all along!
Visually I don’t like the actress they chose. Perhaps she’s convincing in the role performance wise. We shall see. also can Rogue from X-men get her story told accurately now since Ms. Marvel is on the big screen. I mean- shit. 🙄
She punched an old lady in the face. I like her.
That grandma punch alone is worth seeing in theater👌
Ms. Carol Danvers can punch me anytime and I’d feel complete
Before it hit #1 trending
Can you imagine if it was a dude version of captain marvel hitting that old lady? Ohhh the uproar!!! 🤔 im a big marvel fan! But this looks meh! Hell Wonder Woman looks better then this! smh... I mean you make a big deal about captain marvel and all that hype is just meh? Come on man! 👍
I feel bad for the old lady. She died with a punch. She was just sitting. And you punch a old lady. That’s just senior abuse.
just here to watch grandmas get rekt
oh yeah Samuel L.Motherfucking Jackson. "we need u" same shit again and again
'hold mah beer' -jean grey
Did she just...punch an old lady?
Trailer looks sorta shitty generic, but it is marvel after all so I'm still positive
Hands down better than that shitty wonder woman movie
The old lady was probably an alien
I guess the granny is supposed to represent Dc? haha
The way she knocked out a Grandma
wtf, why did she punch granny...
$1 says they cut the old lady punch or it doesnt show up in movie.
Garentee the villian will be a white male
If she kills thanos alone I'm guns be so pissed it better tony she should be the last one to even throw a punch at thanos
enough with granny being punched.
I see captain marvel is friend of eq and Caleb city...out here punching grandmas
She can punch me in the face anyday of the week
People who don't know who skrolls are will be so confused at her punching that poor old lady
Why'd she have to punch the grandma?
poor old lady :D
Wow, this came out of nowhere and it looks like shit.
I hope that old lady she just whacked turns out to be a Skrull not just some poor old lady....
Im freakin blown away!..damn u Marvel! always manage to hit the right freakin spot..hope this will be an awesome build up to the Infinity War ...
Captain marvel: *punches her in the face
Now I know what happened to my grandma
Omfg I'm so hyped!! Captain Marvel is coming to beat the shit out of them Skrulls and Thanos!!
I just wanna know why she punches the old lady other than that meehhhhhh
Şehitler ölme ❤ 
dumb grandma, shouldn't have taken the last seat
shit wrong Captain Marvel was waiting for a kid to say Shazam lol jk movie looks pretty badass can't wait for it. I still find it funny how both Captain Marvel and Shazam come out next year when they are both named Captain Marvel, but ofcourse for legal reason they don't really refer to Shazam as Captain Marvel because of Marvel Comics Captain Marvel, confusing kinda lol next year is gonna be awesome can't wait.
When she smacked that grandma 😂😂😂😂 Discover what makes her a hero
ShapeShifter Old Lady got punched...That makes me Metro Hero..

Damn Skrull assuming form of an old lady? Dick move  Skrulls.... Dick move. 👵
wait why did she punch the granny
She did NOT just punch that lil old lady out?! Can't wait to see this shit!
Honeslty this reminds me a ton of Ryan Reynolds green Lantern .
Getting hit without a reason.
Hmm i just don't like Brie Larson as Captain Marvel she's not superhero looking .. I like her as an actress yes but to hold an iconic character out of a comic book you should look majestic also she's not even that sexy !! Oh well Marvel's decision hope this movie rocks ..
lol my favourite scene is when Captain Marvel smacked the old lady
Is it just me or does this feel like Green Lantern? I don't mean that its going to be shit, but the plot and character dynamics feel similar...
My favourite part was when she slapped the old woman
Booyah. Now this looks AWESOME. The is so the start of the Skrull invasion. Who goes on a bus and Punches a sweet old lady.The return of Colsen and Nick Fury with BOTH eyes?!... Oh it's about to go down.
Damn she socked that old lady
Just imagined If a guy punched that old lady.........:..
I dont really who that granny slapping hero is but she better save the avengers
1:31 R.I.P old grandma😂😂
Captain Marvel getting an Oscar for punching that old lady 😂
That poor old lady she dindu nuffin
Granny got pwned
New Nick Fury is shit
Lastly, props to punching an Elderly woman! They knew putting that in the trailer would start us talking! WooHoo!
Plot twist thanos turns into an old lady
"Carol, how'd you know that old lady was a skrull?"
1:31 when your grandmas ugly
Well I don't want to see captain marvel after that shitty trailer
The biggest threat of all, an old lady sitting on the bus.
1:31 why did the grandma deserve that😂
She straight up punched the shi! out of that old lady.
What the....!! She punched old lady...!!! lol
Sold! It's like Marvel Studios just falls out of bed and another great comic book movie is made. They make it look so easy. No wonder the suits at Warner Bros get so frustrated.
I’m guessing the old lady she punched is a Skrull
Holy Shit!!! Can't wait!
1:31 me react to people doesn’t give a shit about capital marvel character
Hell, I'd punch an old lady in the face if she gave a big smile, and a welcome to planet Earth.
I felt the same way about the "Antman" trailer and, of course, Paul Rudd proved me wrong. I hope this is the same way because this trailer did nothing for me but make me want to hug my grandma (1:30).
Shit the camera work, editing and music is ON POINT
1 like= 1 prayer for the old lady.
i'm just chilling and waiting for the movie, so that all people who talk shit shutting their mouth
Grandma: Oh thanks sweetheart how kind of you letting me si....
The grandma was a skrull geez even tho it was funny 😂😂😂
Robo 2.0 teaser looking better..  2.0 fans hit likes
Captain marvel : hold my water .....
Why did she just hit the old lady 😂😂
Why hire an actress with zero gravitas for this role? I'm not sold on this character in the first place, but this casting seems really off if she is supposed to be one of the most powerful heroes in the MCU.
This is first marvel movie trailer, which I m not gonna watch twice or more. It simply looks shitty. 
Punching old lady in the face, yeaaah!
HAHAHAHA she punched an old lady XD
Is it cold here or why am i getting so much chills???
oml i couldnt help but laugh when captain marvel smacked the old lady...... im going to hell...
I was told she can beat Thanos? Nah, i don't buy it, that would make her the power of all powers, she does not look that good to me in this trailer.
I think she is thanos's grandma 1:30
Captain marvel Fan 😎 hit like
Why did she beat an old lady? We have no context here... as far as we can tell she is into elder abuse!
I didnt like the trailer cause she punched an old women i mean with her strenght she could've killed her
Punching an old women is not a heroic thing!
Wow why TF did captain marvel hit grandma
When she beat the old women i couldn’t stop laughing *im a monster i know*
Why you punch grandma?!
Please be an awesome superhero movie with as little feminist bullshit as possible.
1:30 when grandma forgets the cookies
There's gonna be a spate of little girls whacking old  ladies on the bus..........  Do like that " wolf howl " music though...
Plot twist, the granny the he-she punched is just an old lady who wouldn't give up her chair.
shit... i don't feel my eyes right now😅😅😑
1:30 Whos Grandma ??? 🤣
1:30 when grandma forgets to make peanut butter cookies when you come to visit
The Dislikes Its From The Peoples That Sees Captain Marvel Punch The Old Lady
The old lady is a skrull the probably main bad guys and they are shapeshifters
👍🏻1 like = 1 flower for the grandma💐
I have seen cartoon versions of thanos war with Avengers and in it black widow and then cap get hold of infinity stones
she punched a old woman dude!
Why would she punch an old lady?
any way her first target was an old lady...
Plot twist: thanos used the reality stone to look like an old woman
I have no idea what the story is about, who "Captain Marvel" is, aside from a granny basher. And why is it the actress seems to pretty much have only one facial expression? The heck?!?!
*Shit effects.*
Doesnt reveal shit for infinity war
Finally not some fan made bullshit trailer😍
Grandma is Thanos
can't wait for these dipshits in the comments to roll in thinking this movie is all about feminism.
I am so looking forward to a blooper with the granny , just imagine if the skrull is behind Marvel
That grandma didn't thank the bus driver.
That old lady is a scrull
the old lady being punched was thanos's mom she caused infinity war
1:31 why did she punched that old lady? xD
the reason why she punched the grandma's face is because the grandma is actually one of the evil shapeshifter aliens called the Skrulls. And then someone will be a skrull and betray Nick Fury and then he'll lose his eye. And Captain Marvel will end up in the present time, after the snap, at the end of the movie.
1:30 she punches a granny! LOL
Why do they have to do shit like this, like seriously just make a part 2 for the avengers man, not this before and after shit. I actually got hyped when I saw the title but now watching the trailer, it doesn't seem like much.
Why did she hit a grandma I really hope there is no back story to it
Thats not an old lady she is a skrull
When she slapped old lady.
I love that EVERYBODY...is talking about C.M. punching an old women...😐🤣
Oh shit, there's nobody there except Thanos, which means he propably watched it.
*Nostalgia hits*
1:30 when your grandma makes cookies and they are not ready
Looks shit bland and boring.
What a shit marvel has  created
You need to punch a Old Lady to become Captain Marvel 😂
She bitched slapped that old lady!!!! Makes me more intrigued to watch it more.
Ok guys I've seen the captain marvel trailer and rememnber that captain marvel punced an old lady don't mercy on the old lady because that wasn't a true old lady it's a skrull
Look I know why she punches the old lady (she's a skrull and all) but to someone who doesn't know who captain Marvel and the skrulls are, they might think captain Marvel is a bad hero.
In every Marvel trailer the same shit. "Comic fans" in the comments who think they know everything but haven't picked up a comic in like 15 years. Noobs
1:30 Old Lady was a scroll disguised?
you guys are complaining about the trailer being lackluster but honestly? I hope they save all the cool shit for the film so I can see it first time on the big screen. I hate when they give away the coolest action moments in the trailers (like that car flip in black panther was so dope! can you imagine if they hadn't shown it all around first and hadn't played it over and over i'd've lost my god damn mind) The trailer shouldn't give away the coolest shit it's supposed to show you samples of everything (from the 90s touches to the space alien shit) and maybe a funny or two like seriously yall be wanting the entire movie's climax moment in a trailer to be interested.
Punches Old Woman in her face, Takes the superhero name from a Orphan kid...She is a menace....
Only watching for the grannys sake
That old lady was Loky after avengers 3
Punched the hell out of that old lady
*Slapping old women*
I was gonna go on about how this is hot garbage, and then she punched an old lady in the face... well played Marvel.
She punches like a girl.
Punching grandma: check
She punches an old lady
Did Captain marvel just punch an old lady? 😨
Thats my seat grandma
The woman she punched was a skrull
Damn she just slaped that old lady Pure Savage right there😂😂😂😂😂
Bland. But I'm a straight white guy. The hell do I know? But hey! Caulsons back!
I'm really just wondering why she just punched a grandma that smiled at her.
1:30 when granny didn't cook you dinner😂
1:31 Why did she punch the elderly lady?
We might have to start incorporating punching old ladies onto our show 😭 
So yah, this woman's gonna kick Thanos butt. *punches old lady*

I feel bad for uncontrollably laughing when she right hooked the granny😂😂😂
Did she just punch an old lady 😂💀
Rip Old lady at 1:31 / 1:56
Honestly it looks so shit.
about time to hit trending.
**old lady smiles**
1 like = 1 respect for the old lady
My only thought was “they made samuel l look so young.... orkingsman made him look so old”
Grandma you're such a sweet woma....
Wow she punched grandma and do you see that blockbuster sign at  video shop
When the source material (Captain Marvel [Carol Danvers] comics) is shit, then the movie is most likely going to be the same. Without a doubt.
Holy shit here before 1 mil!
*immediately punched an old woman on the train*
These comments for grandma..😂😂😂
1:30 She knocked the S**T out that old lady! ......😂
Punch in to an elder’s face is a way to become a hero 1:31
@1:31 she punchea a grandma wtf 😂
Going to hold off on this movie until reviews. Hopefully it's good.
Plot twist: Grandma is not a skrull, but is a grandma! XD
*Grandma: Somebody once told me...*
Old people: you should eat more. Put on some weight.
Wow. This trailer is Loud and sounds like everyother trailer. Brie Larson though? I'm in. (And seriously: "Insert: punch old woman in the face"?)
Captain Marvel: Grandma, I'm back with movies from Blockbuster!
16k mad cause she punched that old ldy
Not gonna watch this shit, ill wait for the next avengers.
Did she seriously hit an old woman in the face...? Wtf Marvel? xD
So, this is all about white hole and black hole, that's why she's still young, isn't it?
The amount of people complaining or even questioning why she hits what appears to be an old woman shows why it can be so hard to present certain characters to a casual audience. without knowledge of source material, which a large amount of people who go to these movies do not have, its hard to understand the way these characters think. thats why its taken ten years of building characters to get to infinity wars. captain marvel should have had her movie a year or two ago in preparation for infinity war so that way we know why she wasnt IN it.
Edited to add: Other people have pointed out similarities with Superman and I sort of agree. When you have a superOP character like this, making them likeable is sort of the first thing to do in order to make watching the movie any sort of entertaining, and the approach used here absolutely does not appeal to me. (I had the same problem with Cap. He is just too goody-two-shoes bland for me.) I would've liked a cool badass lady on screen, but this isn't it. I hope people enjoy it anyway, but recent Marvel solo movies have been hit or miss for me, so I'm a little more careful, I guess.
Why you gotta do granny like dat tho
Grandma meme on the internet
She locked out that old lady
Captain Marvel can punch an old lady like a bulldozer!!!!
why is captain marvel punching that granny???
Grandma got knocked tf out
You know, Captain Marvel punching grannys might send the wrong message to the children.
Angela Del Toro White Tiger movie next please 🖤🖤🖤
1:30 when your grandma tells you to put your phone away
I hope that old lady wasn’t a skrull it would be funnier that way
Looks like it's going to be shit.
Wakanda shit is dis
Omg people don't stop complaining! It's just so annoying that a movie can't just be a movie! Holy shit man
Wow another fictional Super hero and to top it off she fights evil organizations such as an old lady taking the train..........
Thinking maybe it's a Krull who is punching that little old lady on the train
She beat that Skrull that looked like a grandma lmao
old lady is a skrull?
What a horrible, disgusting person, what kind of hero would hit an old lady? This movie is going to be TERRIBLE!
This looks really shit.
Aight cool guys but like why did it take 5 comments for me to see something about an old woman getting punched in the trailer (even if she is just a disguise.)
at 1:30  did she just punched an old woman !?
Poor old lady skrull
Oh shit this lit asf
Just beat the shit out of that old lady
I loved the part where she slapped the old lady.
when you say you're full but grandma tries to feed you another brownie 1:30
Hit like if your here before a million. Marvel fan forever. Marvel is life.
The old lady could be Loki
old lady punching, possibly Nolan style parallel timelines, young Nick Fury and Brie Larson 
But I'd love to see a meme out of Captain Marvel punching the old lady lmao
Granma gets punched
The only interesting part was her punching the old lady.  Other than that, this is very underwhelming and unimpressive.
*Why the grandmaaaaaaa xddd*
She hits an old lady!!!
Poor Grandma. lol :)
What's up with her punching old ladies.
Space Invasion big car chase I was ready to hang it up today until I met you. So that means that there was a Cree invasion and a big car chase and it all happened the same day that she fell through the Blockbuster. It is likely that the autopsy being performed is the guy who hit Nick Fury's eye and caused the damage. And since we know that it was skrull on the table we can assume that a skrull had change their identity and attacked Nick Fury before he knew what was happening. After the attack of fury, the  Escape pod from the explosion at the start of the ad was likely skrulls that escaped. Likely the ones we saw walking out of the water. After the attack on Fury,  the exposed skrull likely escaped and pursuit insued, hence the car chase mentioned. Captain marvel likely takes out  more than one skrull since there was more than one. The old lady might be the one on the bus, but the chase ensued  in the train station. 
I came here to see an old lady get punched in the face.
Şehitler ölme❤ 
How do any of you think she’s punching an older woman? How do you not realize it a Skrull?
1:31 did she just punch an old lady?!!!!! 😂
...Punches an old lady.
Did she punch a grandma in the face? lmao
And I thought they had finally gotten to the weird-arse comic-booky crazy shit. I knew it was to good to be true.
If agree hit like
I love the part where she smackes the granny in the face
It would be awesome if captain Marvel was fighting Thanos in Avenger 4 and  Ms.Marvel got punched so hard she got warped to previous time'.
Rip Grandma 1:31 , we will never forget you :(
(John 14:2-3)<---In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will (((come again))), and (((receive you))) (((unto myself))); that where I am, there ye may be also).
Ok first things first. I love how it's like 'find out how she became a hero' and then just knocks the granny out like wtf
Why she slap the old woman
Yoooo you could have asked the grandma
Grandma gets slapped...a small price to pay for salvation.
God her face is so flat and annoying it makes me want to punch an old lady in the face.
Wait, as there a seen where that girl hit an old woman? Wonder if that makes in the movie
You had me at block buster video and punching grandma
Maybe the trailer is just poorly cut. But this looks boring. Her look is not very good. The faces she is making are insanely wooden. I see none of the talent that she had in Room or the charm that she had in Free Fire. Not to mention those comments about white men's opinions. This all seems to be going down a bad path. And if this comes out and is received poorly by fans, just dammit. It will be so vicious. Get ready for another The Last Jedi level of upset fandom.
why she punch the ol'lady xD
*For the 1% who sees this good luck in your future! Damn Dat Granny Doh. 😂* 👍.  i've just made it to  69K Subs Thanks to all inspirations Wish me luck for 70k!
You know a movie is old when it has a blockbuster 🤣
Ms Marvel - "Yep & so does this granny.."
Srsly how?!?!??!??  Wait does he never grow old? Ok now I'm even more dying to watch this I have 100 reasons to watch this now😂😂😂😂😂😂
This shit can ruin the entire Marvel Universe......Disappointed.
Hit like for Phil Coulsan 😁
I love how LITERALLY everyone is talking about Carol punching the old woman. 😤 ITS A SKRULL IDIOTS.
Grandma jokes incoming
1:31 punched  a grand mother 😅😅
Punching old ladies😂
Ghadam she punched an old lady right in the face
I expected more from this.But this seems total crap to me.The only thing in the film I am curious about is why she punched that old lady?
When your grandma doesn't make another batch of cookies 1:30
Oh bull shit where is thenos ...
Nice trailer. Not pumped. I do like how I see a skrull disguising as an old lady. It has put a smile to my face.
wow Shit for 2 min 150k views
Can I punch my grandma now too?
I know smacking grandma was suppose to be a funny scene, but the music, overall tone, and her facial expression made it so dead serious i wasn't sure how to take it...
Captian Marvel's Nemisis: grandma
01:31 when Grandma promised to give you a $100 dollar bill as a birthday gift to you but decides to be a cheap ass instead and changes her mind
You’re man’s grandma made her last snide comment about your cooking at Thanksgiving.1:30
Şehitler öl❤ 
When she hits the grandma though
Grandma : your trailer is not that
why she hit that old lady
I wasn't sure about this movie.  But in one trailer, I saw a Blockbuster video chirp AND Brie Larson punch an old lady in the face (obvi a Skrull but still).  I will be seeing this opening night.
Bruh, she just punched an old lady at 1:31. How does that make "Her" a "Hero" LOL.
Is that granny in the granny game? Hahah
One hit grandma dead😂😂😂
last superman? a cold heart one
Grandma: the Shazam trailer was better 
Am I the only one who thought the best part was when she punched an old lady on the bus
I’m pretty sure coulson is supposed to be like 25-30 years old in this movie.  He looks essentially the same but with more hair
Did she just punch an old lady!?
It sure would be easy to assume that old woman Carol punches is a Skrull... But there's a chance that she isn't a Skrull, and that it's a comedy bit. These movies know when to get serious and dramatic, but the 180's they make for the sake of humor happen just as often.
I don't know why. But that part where she slapped the crap of the old woman made was funny as hell.
Looks shit..but we still gona watch it aren't we..
Holy shit that looks so bad 😐😖
So is know one gonna talk about the fact she punched an old lady
_Yup that grandma was definitely a threat..._
I came here for two reasons. Old ladies being punched in the face.
I have waiting for this one. A small question why did she hit that old lady?
Worse trailer ever and worse movie ever if u gonna have a villain don't maje it a cute old lady
I'm lost asf as to what is going on here, but I'm down 🤷🏽‍♂️. Only thing I'm not liking with her is that they are claiming she's the strongest person they've introduced so far which is just complete bullshit and my dawg Hulk needs a buff
Old grandma : You are after the wrong person
She punched the old lady because she’s an alien shapeshifter
Man she smacked the shit outta that old lady
This looks shitty !
hit the like if you a fan of Marvel movies . im so excited
Despite punching an old lady, pretty sure that’s because the Skrull can obtain any organic form like humans and animals so.
1:30 The old lady is Thanos confirmed!
Which genius thought it was a good idea to put the footage of her smacking a grandma in the face? i know that grandma is probably a fake but come on, first impression matters, of all the scenes you could of pick to promote a superhero, you picked THAT?
punching old ladies
she punched somebody grandma!!!
bullshit, BULLshit... derivative
Am I the only one who died as soon as she stolled on that old lady?? Shit had me laughing my ads off.
I don’t care if this pisses off feminists I actually hope it does but this looks like a shit film just to make marvel not look sexist
This movie is based in the 90s! So hold tight for a flash back from the past.
Poor old lady :(
You’re doing amazing sweetie 😆😆😆😆😆😆❤️😍 but slap old lady ... why 😕!!! Wait the movie to explain that ......
You just can't slap an old woman
this trailer feels old..it looks like the first Iron Man trailer back in 2008
that out of context punch to that old lady looks wild. who cut this trailer that way? lmao
Marvel is going to shit on DC💩💩😂😂
When she punched that old lady that might have been a skrull disguising as an old lady
Just want to point out the obvious which is Captain Marvel is punching the Old Lady because it's a skrull in disguise. I'm surprise many don't know that and I'm a DC fan. As for the trailer I know it's the first one posted but what I've seen from the clips given and the actress' performance isn't doing Captain Marvel's character any just. The actress sounds monotone when's she's giving her lines. As for her facial expression it looks pretty bland even when she's using her powers at the end of the trailer. I know this is the first trailer and there more to come but so far I'm not hyped about it.  Would have wished that Dianna Agron, Charlize Theron, or Amanda Seyfried as captain Marvel.
Hitting the elderly isn't something one considers fun, but this does put a smile on my face.
The old lady is a Skrull, enemies of the Nova Corps, whom Captain Marvel is affiliated with. Skrulls are shapeshifting aliens.
Hide ya kids, hide ya wives, and hide *ya grandmas* from Captian Marvel. She out here swinging on em
Old lady is a Skrull, question answered.
She Punched A Granny
Did she just punch a old lady!?
This movie looks like it was made in the 90s I mean holy shit come on marvel you can do better we know you have the money she looks like a captain planet reject and the light and lazer affects look like power ranger level wtf come on pick up your game she can look cooler
Man im not going to see this shit
She just punched Aunt May
find out, what makes her... a hero.... punches old lady in the face
So a white woman is gonna save the universe. Great.
All I wanna see now is her and granny fight to the death.
Going old school with Blockbuster. Nice!
Well, at least I can finally cross “get a boner from Brie Larson sucker-punching an old lady in the face” off my bucket list.
Punch her.
This is the HERo we need. Someone who's not afraid to deck old ladies right in the jaw. My God this looks exponentially better than Wonder Woman.  And best of all: No trailer for the trailer!!!!
OMG! Did she seriously punch that old lady? 😂😂😂
Okay, she just punched a old woman. I wanna see it now
Grandma got younger after that punch.
1:30 she just killed an old lady
Captain Marvel is for me a MAN! So sad that the studios pushing women quota... lame! Fantasy is ok.. BUT nature tells another story! Woman are not as hard as man! never ever... seeing a woman punching and kicking around man is so ridiculous! And i know what i am talking about.. cause i am a martial arts fighter for over 2 decades... female emancipation is also a big plan to divide man and woman... it is also ridiculous! Also the movie title is quite miss leading... i should be: Mrs. Marvel HAHA!! but toxic TransGender is everywhere! fry in hell idiots... Nature will punish you anyway!
Please don't be as bad as the shit ass comics
Captain old lady puncher.
*Yeetus yeetus old woman beatus*
Goddamn these comments are autistic gold
She was raised in Blockbuster, what did you expect that she will not hit an old lady?
She punch grandma without reason? Right?
Can't wait to see her punching thanos
With great strength comes the great responsibility of punching old ladies in the face
1:30 whenever an old lady pinches my cheek
Shitty trailer...
That grandma is a skrull
This is some postmodernist joyless shit. Massive departure from the rest of you upload. What are you doing?
This is literally shit...looks like a trailer for some tv series and the actress is just too emotional.  No superhero vives
Grandma she punched was a Skrull, which is a species that are the main antagonists of the movie
Hitting a grandma
1:31 when grandma gives you veggies instead of sugar
>shows clip of main character hitting an old lady
She hit an old woman !?
This that twilight shit with the moody emotionless dialogue
Every mcu movie since Winter Soldier was perfect, so ı expect this to be perfect too, it's literally a cliche for a mcu movie to be great, unique, funny, emotional. So yeah, high expectations as always, probs gonna make a billion at the box office..
Man marvel fandome we really do this shit #1 on trending n over 13 million views in less than 13 hrs
I was sold when Brie got the role. Knew she'd ace it.
This is the most unoriginal cookie cutter mainstream dog shit I have ever seen. Just because it's Marvel does not make it exempt from criticism. Looks bad.
Did captain Marvel hit an old lady👵
She just puched an old lady man! 
Rip to the grandma that she hit
Punching an old lady. . . .how "heroic"
That grandma is a Skrull
I was hoping that Olivia Wilde was going to play Captain Marvel. Brie Larson's acting is meh. She needs more edge, or she'll come off dull like Superman. That's the problem with super powerful characters, they don't translate well. The studio will give us the same old backstory to try to make her relatable, showing us her childhood and something tragic blah blah blah. I don't care about her being a little girl. I don't need that much of a back story. I hope they keep it simple. Start from her life in the Air Force, show how bad ass she is, move on to the powers, and introduce the Skrulls.
What if that old lady isn’t a scrull and captain marvel just wanted a seat on the train
Not watching thanks to her anti white male comments.
Ah she’s not that strong. I think I would win. Quick chest workout before and I’m good to go. Pick in someone your own size not granny’s
The old lady is very likely going to be revealed as a Skrull in disguise, but out of context, that's still a really odd thing to put in the trailer.
We can put our trust in Captain Marvel!! *watches her hit old lady* .... must have been an editing mistake
This looks shit.
Shitty trailer. Hope the movie is better
haha feel sorry for the grandma.
Skrull old lady? Skrull Stan lee cameos?
Holy shit, Coulson has hair!!!
The only one she attacked in this trailer was an old woman, so now they're promoting elderly abuse? great... anyway this looks BOOORING!! This is the female captain America, and it looks like a replica of his first movie which was a snore. Not impressed or enthused by this trailer all.
Sam Jackson and old lady's getting punched.. Take my money
1:30 when your grandma forgets her life alert at home.
poor granny lmaooooo
A bit of an underwhelming trailer for supposedly the most powerful hero in the MCU. I'm glad she punched that old lady though. The bitch had it coming, I think.
She has such a punchable face
Superpower is sucker punch an old lady and not be judged.
Do you guys realize that the grandma is a skrull
Don't worry about the grandma who got punched.
Grandma: I made them with rasins no chocolate and no sugar 
thanos maybe will scary at scene he show is an old lady maybe
I hope the old lady isn't a skrull😂
Female White Privilege the Movie
I’ve never have wanted to punch an old woman so bad in my life.
I put the 1:30 scene in slow motion to see if the old lady was transforming into something else. I shouldn’t have, now I feel bad for the poor lady.
Oh god why that grandma RIP
She punched an old lady?!? 😂
1:30 she knocked the grandma into the soul stone
she rocked that old lady
I’m going to the theaters just to see her socket punch that old lady
So, she destroys the last Blockbuster and obliterates a sweet old lady on a subway? This is gonna be a good movie
Thanos vs Grandma
Hit like for this old lady😂
Plot twist: the old lady was was actually an old man. Audience calms and accepts it as just cause
ahh snap....another hit for marvel...coming at ya!!!!
great trailer and another hit. No surprise at the agro hate this is bringing.  Keep doubting Marvel. You been doing it for ten years and getting educated every time.
That poor old lady.....
I'm sorry but that part when she beats the old lady is so hilarious
Just me that got a feeling she's going to be a Villain? Probably cause she punched the granny.
Marvel making too many dumb movies. I can't believe people go to the movies and pay for this shit smh.
Grandma was a Skrull. That's why she got punched.
I don't get it with the old lady jokes???
This movie will be the beginning of the end of the Marvel live action golden age, it was a hell of a run!
Dc shazam way better than this shit
Why did he hit the aunt?
1:28 the old lady
Captain M: Hold my beer.
That old lady has to be stronger than Thanos if she can take a hit like that
Captain Marvel: The Granny Puncher
First film marvel, which looks like a shit
A good little snack to hold me over until infinity war
whyd she punch the grandmother? Sorry im not that like informed abt Captain Marvel
If you're gonna get her to punch someone old in the face then it should have been Stan Lee after he says something stupid.
Ohh,shit i cant wait
Even in these comments- finding a new path means abandoning the perspective of your old one, the thoughts that made you seek anew. Art manifests out of the imagination, just like flight, physics, and chemistry... it is “hard to explain” as we strive and change, we grow. 
hold my coca cola. going to punch some random old lady on the subway.
spread memes captain marvel hit the grandma
Dear marvel. Unlike other characters we don't know her.  Make us feel connected to her for us to understand her role in iw2. Anyways, we have coleson in this movie so it's gonna be a hit 😍
Why she punched the old lady?? I don't understand..
plot twist: Granny is The Beyonder
Captain Marvel just punched an old woman on a train, imagine what she'll do to Thanos..lol
Kinda looks like shit.
Did she just punch an old lady in the face?
I wonder people’s reaction to the Old lady being punched if they don’t know about the Skrulls
She punch an old lady
AWesome teaser! This is better than most superhero movies specially those shitty ones with ben affleck and the other ones
If they don´t have that old lady fighting Carol for over 5 minutes in front of more civilians, I´m gonna be (even more) disappointed.
A dark void...  Big Band music plays.  The light in the center of the room comes up, revealing a young Peggy Carter.  She looks up as she hears "May I have this dance?"  Pan out to Steve in white dress shirt and khakis.  Peggy replies that he's late, as both their eyes fill with tears.  They embrace and begin to dance.  "I'm sorry for keeping my best girl waiting."  Fade to black, as the credits continue, still playing the dance music.
The ending credit needs to have her with short hair and is about to punch a skrull that she is interrogating but then he turns to ash and she gets the message from Fury
What makes a hero? *punches an old woman 1:30
The old lady was a skrull too.
*2.4K dislikes from Green Lantern fans or that old lady fans* 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:31 when your grandma doesn’t have food
Oooh shit. Nega Bands, Binary powers, and the amnesia story line? Not bad really. 
Min 1:30  ...It’s revealed the old lady says: “ _My lord! Your husband let you wear that in public young lady_ ?”
1:30 in case ur wondering the person she hit wasn’t a old lady it was a scroll (shape shifting being)
Everyone’s obsessing about the grandma who gets punched
Hit a like you didn't understand shit what this trailer is about.
@1:30 When Grandma forgets to make the cookies I like.
That music...... Hits the spot
Lmao she punch the grandma i'm screaming I CAN'T WAIT i was scared tbh i hope that the movie Will be dope
Shitty actress!!!!!
Oohhhh Green Lantern! I’ve seen this movie before! I hope Ryan Reynolds comes back ❤️❤️❤️
As someone who liked ragnarok and guardians I appreciate they went for a more serious tone for a cosmic mcu movie. You can also grasp the movie's themes about Carol recovering her humanity and never staying down. There's always the second trailer to see her blowing shit up with a classic 90s rock song, that would feel more generic imo.
1:30 I think the grandma is a scroll. As in the species that can shape ship
That old lady was the dc universe.
Even if the old lady wasnt a skrull (which she still might not be) i would belive she would punch her if she was normal, she probably dared critiscize her appearance
oh shit, finally
Which of her TWO facial expressions did you enjoy most?  The "im punching" face, or the "Im doing everything else except punching" face? 
Why did she punch that old women?
what is this shit? I didn't feel it
Old Lady That Is Skrulls
Captain Marvel: *Punches old lady and beats her up*
Holy shit I can’t wait to see this
Spider mans *grandma*
Oh, hell yes! 1:32 - Ronan is back.1:46 - Oh shit, Binary!!!!!
pretty sure the old lady is a skrull? sooo..u guys can unclench
Marvel: "..........IT'S JUST BEEN REVOKED!!!!" *punch* >8D
You're right. I thought you were a superhero, but it turns out you're just a woman who viciously assaults sweet old ladies.
That grandma is probably a skrull
1:28 White walker spotted
shit movie anime is better
Why’s she just punch someone’s grandma 😂 Rude 😂
That old lady got yeeted 👵🏼
Looks pretty shit
1:31 so captain marvel hits grandmas now
Hitech Aisa maine kabhi trailer Nahi Dekha both both both Achha
Punching TF out of granny.
U smacked a *Grandmama*
If she can punch an old lady in the face then she can definitely kill Thanos. Thanos gan be shook
1:30 *_How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old woman?_*
Damn, she just punched an old lady.
Why did she just flipping whip that old lady DANGG
Looks like utter horseshit. Did an intern make this trailer?
Oof the grandma
The cgi looks shitt.. bvs is better than this..
Holy shit this looks amazing
Smackin old ladies like a pimp lol
Starring Brie Larson the chick who said she "doesn't hate white dudes" three times, while simultaneously giving a speech about why there should be less white men reviewing movies. It will be interesting to find out what kind of rating this gets on Rotten Tomatoes.
Are we just gonna ignore her decking the old lady or
How do ppl know if the grandma is a skrull?
Can you people please stop judging movies before the movie even comes out. Everyone thought all these DCEU movies would be good and in reality they were shit. So maybe this will surprise you?
Tbh... I was more hype for the shot of BlockBuster. Also you shouldn’t have her punch an old lady before showing us who the Skrulls are
me: i hope she punches an old la-
I feel so bad for the old lady
Worst Milf movie...shit
guys you sholdn't judge a book by its cover Suicide Squad has an  awesome cover and it is not a good movie.
Steven Spielberg and James Cameron told Scarlet Witch to put a Hex on Kevin Feige to make this stupid movie, have her be the team leader in Infinity War Pt. 2 which will start the beginning of the end to the MCU franchise. Scarlet Witch decided to do it because Kevin Feige is retiring her to the MCU Streaming. Like Samual L Jackson might say: Take that mother f_ _ _ _r. !!!! :)
 I hope this movie will be a blockbuster hit!
What a shit trailer
What makes her a hero punching a poor grandma 😂
Captain Marvel: stfu grandma.
I was so excited that I accidentally hit my finger bed and I just finished washing off the blood BUT CAPTAIN MARVEL IS SO AWESOME!!!!!! YES CAPTAIN MARVEL! FREAKIN CAPTAIN MAERVL
Can't wait how Grandma will exchange blows with her ROFL
1:31 When your fake teeth are stuck in your mouth so you say shit to a superhero so they knock it out.
1:30 would you like a sugar cube dear,captain marvel I'm allergic to sugar *punch*
This shit gonna save everybody?
Stop complaining about elderly abuse guys. Captain Marvel fights for justice, and she knows those dirty senile old people just don't pull their weight in society anymore. So she's culling them to help us advance as a fair and just civilization, without those useless grannys sapping our hard earned tax dollars for their social security benefits.
1:30 Grandma - * smiles * CM - wtf was that for!?
Looks like a shitty Netflix show tbh
Followed up by Captain Marvel socking a grandma.
Grandma:Dc Is better than Marvel 
Punching elderly people in public is finally ok again!!!
There is a 99.9999999999% chance that that old lady is a scroll. Either that or the old lady took her seat.
From these comments, it looks like people think that this will be a prequel to a Captain Marvel vs. Thanos final fight. I think she is more of a missing puzzle piece rather than the unitary force that defeats Thanos. She holds valuable information that will propel the story forward. Have a little faith guys!
For comparison: If someone saw the Black Panther trailer and said dumb shit like "Marvel's pushing their black agenda, now their movies are gonna suuck", they would be racist.
Can anyone ignore that punch to grandma 😁😁😁
Mgk : Old Lady : your beard’s weird
Why is the "Captain Marven punches old lady" the one scene that made me want to watch the movie?
You can tell this movie is set back cause Nick got both of his eyes and there's a blockbuster 🤔 I just wanna see the old lady get hit on big screen 👌
Shittiest trailer from marvel.
mrs marvel :punches old woman
Waiting for the movie just for that punching on the grandma'S face scene! Poor granny!!
For the people hating on carol for punching that old lady 1:30 the old lady is obviously a skrull i am like 1000% sure
"Evacuate the city, engage all defenses and get this old woman a shield"
Not all heros punch old ladies...
If we know anything about Captain Marvel, it's that she likes punching old women in the face. 10/10 marvel
Did she just punch a elderly lady
When your grandma knows what your doing behind her back and she blackmails you
1:31 captain marvel punched an old lady😐😐😐
If they go with that hole feminist shit, this movie is gonna suck
didn´t you think that instead of an old lady it could be somebodyelse with the superpower of turning himself in to someone else???
Hell of a lot of Marvel "fans" who don't realize that granny is a Skrull....
“Captain marvel” more like hitting old women’s.

Did she just punch a old lady?!
Am I the only one not that impressed by the trailer?  I mean the Grandma scene is hilarious and seeing Phil Coulson on the big screen again is amazing but, the trailer felt really lackluster in my opinion.
Grandma punch = meme material
Old lady: "hey young lady, how are you d--
1:31 she just punched the shit out of that old lady!
Think of how much harder the Spiderman -Tony Stark scene at the end of Avengers would have hit if it had come at the end of a Spiderman trilogy and there was a legit chance he might really be gone instead of him being in production for a sequel.
1:30 when grandma doesn’t give you the toy you wanted for christmas
Remember when Grandma ate all your delicious Double-Chocolate Milano cookies, 
Brie Larson looking bored while punching an old lady
Use Time stone to never let Captain Thot take the power from real captain marvel. They bring him back and they take on thanos. The end. This character looks sorry. Shes op yet cant do basic air force training. Let alone punch properly.
She punched that old lady's lights out
1:31 when my grandma made empanadas and did't tell me or saved me some

Captain Marvel punching an old lady for apparently no reason other than alien/human misunderstanding:
shit is getting ridiculous now
When it's your birthday and your grandma gives you $3 instead of $5
Wonder if she will care about what white men think of *this* movie? Doesn't matter to me. I won't be paying to see it. Of course, if enough of that happens and the movie misses it's opening goals, white men will be blamed for that. Damned if you do...damned if you don't.
Old Lady: You're not the real Captain Marvel
Are we not going to discuss the fact that she Punch that old lady? 👵 😂

Marvel is making shits nowadays,
*"Evacuate the city, engage all defenses and get this old woman a shield"*
So Captain Marvel is could be older than what she looks to be like Captain America.
In order to become a hero, you must... Punch an old lady??

Everyboday say DC movies are dark, well I just saw a super hero hitting an old woman...😶
Did... did she just punch an old lady?
Plot twist: The old lady is Loki
I'm pretty sure that old lady was a Skrull in disguise. You go Captain Marvel!!! 😂😂
Finally, a superhero going after the real villains: old people.
Here before this trailer hits a million
punching an old lady? she probably deserved it
She looks more like a DC character and the movie itself looks like a Netflix special. Sorry I'm not sold on the character. If anything I'd like to see something like  a standalone shehulk movie.
Did she just knock out that old lady
i will be wearing a onesie with a baybe bottle in the theather this is gold !
grandma grandma
At 1:31 you can see she Punches the teeth out of grandma's mouth 🤛
RIP Blockbuster and that old woman face.
My 12yr old daughter just got arrested for punching an old lady on the bus this morning! She just wanted to be like captain marvel! What a great role model! 👍
i can't stop laughing at her punching Grandma
Damn ms.marvel didnt want her grandma cookie
blackbuster video? is that like, netflix for old people?
I can't believe they spoiled punching that old lady.
I don't like it. What about this character?It's like shit

Facebook: Would you punch an old lady for $1M?

Before everyone freaks out about the old lady getting punched, maybe it’s a skrull in disguise.
Lmao old lady smiles at her..
Bruh this bitch straight up right hooked a old lady xD
Why did she punch the old lady in the face? That's  not cool.

captain marvel: lmao no im gonna go punch a grandma brb
When grandmas cooking was to damn good!👊😂🤣
"What makes her a hero?" Punching old ladies, that's what.
Capt.marvel: (punch)
1:30 she beat the shit out of that old lady.
I can see it now. Come March 2019: "If you don't like this movie, you're a sexist misogynist cisgendered entitled white male." They did the same thing with Black Panther: "If you don't like this movie, you're a racist."
I Think Because The Grandma Say "Wonder Woman" And The Punch
This will be a massive flop such a shit actress to play the role.
She just punched a old woman (Probaly was a bad guy/girl xD)
Old lady: "Hail hydra"
She pimp slapped that old lady 😂
Brie Larsen is a shit actress so i have no hope for it not to mention captain marvel is a very boring one dimensional character with a superiority complex that makes her annoying 👎👎👌
The grandma: We're talking Skrull here, she's either one or that scene is played as a fish out of water moment... I hope it's the former
Marvel: Hold this L
You all bitching about this movie's bad you're not gonna watch it at all. I bet the moment this hit the theatre you'll be the first buying tickets posting on ur ig, quote movie dates tonight, i mean COME ON!
Captain marvel punches the old lady it is very 😂
1:30 me when my Grandma got me the Iphone 8 instead of the X for Christmas
Punching the old lady was my favorite part.
Wtf! She kick ma grandma 😂
I'm interested, not entirely sold, but interested.
It's because they've both punched senior citizens.
1) *Talking shit too early*
Why did she just sock this old lady in the jaw
Did anyone else see captain marvel beat a old lady 😂😂😂
All butt hurt DC fans are accussing marvel for all the shit they find in DC films.
Am i the only one that shocked, when she punched the old lady???
Lol I’m not watching this shit
Two words. Holy Shit!
Yeah good one! punching an old lady, makes you a Hero.
1:31 I love how they just put a scene of her punching the shit out of an old lady with no context. I'm sure there is a good explanation in the movie but part of me hopes she really just assaulted some old lady for no reason.
1:30 Same thing happened to me last time I took the bus. The old lady had it coming tho!
1:30 *RIP Granny*
If my grandma die.
I liked the trailer and look forward to handing over some hard-earned bucs to see the movie, but I think some mention should have been made about the shapeshifting skrulls before it shows Captain Marvel punch a nice old lady. Not everyone is well-versed on all these characters.
This can be a “Dark Knight” comic book movie.  I mean this can be a game changer of how to tell a comic book story.   Imagine how they last 2 seasons of Lost where time and alternative realities where told at the same time.  Just saying.
This movie looks beyond awfu-oh wait, she punched an elderly woman. Nevermind, this looks fantastic.
1:32 this is brutal, a superhero punching an old woman is simply unacceptable that too in a trailer
Wait did yall see she hit an old woman right?
I have to admit it, she is the bravest hero. Cause.. who else is brave enough to punch an old woman?
10/10 Samuel l Jackson and grandma getting punched.
I’m laughing so hard at the grandma comments
Meh looks like white panther  and girl ragnarok looks cool but nothing new
Captain Marvel didn't hurt an old lady right?
Love the way this trailer opens, at the end of Infinity War we’re given that little bit of hope. Yet the first footage we see of Captain Marvel is crashing through a building. Love Marvel’s Story telling and I’m already satisfied this is going to be another Big Marvel Hit.
Looks so good made me wanna punch my grandma
Captain Marvel : (Punches a sweet smiling old woman right in the face)
punched an old lady in the face. nice
Can't wait to see why she punched grandma
The grandma was a Skrull
God her face is annoyingly dull here. Can't act for shit in this trailer. Should have gone with Jude Law as the Captain Marvel. His brief scene looked really good.
hands off grandma!! Looks awesome though!
@1:30 when grandma comes with the medical forms telling you Tyrone is NOT the father of your child
Hitting that Old lady made me hate Brie Larson😂
What a movie shit. You are like netflix, it has nothing to do with the commic
Thanos' mom took a good punch...
Şehit❤ 
That old lady she punched in the trailer has to be a Skrull invader just saying.
That old lady is a skrull, right? Otherwise Captain Marvel is an Elder Abuser...
K so i like trailers that don't give anything away. But i also wasn't even given a reason to give a shit about this movie.
Shitttt... this gives me the thrill that I already want to watch itttt
Me 🤨..Granny assaulter! 😡
Why’d she have to punch an old lady though?
Is it me or her voice sounds a bit off??? It’s like I’m hearing a 10-12 yr old girl??
Did I really just see captain marvel hit an old lady at 1:30 ? Not even Thanos would do that crap. He has standards.
So this is going to save us from Thanos eh? A old lady punching woman
Either the granny has something to do with the villains in this movie, or it's just Loki in the form of a granny (either way still technically a villain since this is the past). I don't know though, but cant wait to see it!
Grandma goes bye bye 😱
I Think the old lady is Thanos's Grandma..😜😝
Imma be honest, I’ve been waiting for this movie for a looooong time. The trailer is shit. It looks boring as hell.
1:30 when granny bakes *Raisin cookies* instead of *Chocolate chip*
Old lady punch had me laughing so hard
She punched tf outta that old lady🤣
1:46 the most epic moment. Hit the like if you agree.
Blue-eyed blonde hair white girl to save the day from another planet it might as well be Superman
How does Nick Fury look older in this
They had me when she decked that old lady...Marvel got another $15 outta me!
When black Panther came out white men were being barred from watching the movie and got called colonizer, wonder what the feminist are gonna do for this
1:31 RIP Granny.
1:31 when grandma cuts you out of the will
I think everyone forgetting that she is not human so she doesn't show emotions like us and FYI anyone that hits a old lady like that must be bad ass 👊👊☠
Punches an old woman 
The old lady is a skrull you nubs
I kept wondering why she would punch that old lady in the face, then I remembered....
Damn MY grandma felt that hit.
Hit number one trending👍🏻
Brie Larson punching Grandmom isn’t much of a stretch from when she said a black guy was trying to rape her for just giving her a compliment
It would be hilarious if that grandma isn't a Skrull.
Grandma got punched so bad i really want to see that whole clip😂😂😂
Remember kids, punching granny's will always make you a hero.
She just punch an old woman
When she smacked the old lady...😅
Why punishing a old lady in the face
Captain America punched Hitler in the face!
Grandma:are u wonder woman?
I don't actually think this looks bad like other comments.  I would actually prefer a bit less action in these super hero movies.  Good story line and writing is interesting just mindless action gets old.
That moment when Coulson hits the big screens again !!
1:30 One thing about shape shifters: They always disguise themselves as old people
Just watched all marvel movies for the first time and today i finished whit infinity war 10 minutes later this trailer drops
Wow! Marvel is taking their franchise to bold new creative heights, which include punching elderly people in the face.
0:39 nick fury is holding his eye looking at dead skrull
Saitama: One punch man

Old lady: I... had... to.

Is she is going to beat Thanos bullshit
2019 old ladies getting punched
Wow the nostalgia hit me when I saw the Block Buster sign
Jesus, she just punched the crap out of that old lady.
BREAKING NEWS: Superhero beats the shit out of a Grandmother
This shit gave me chills
Grandma got the taste punched out of her mouth
I’m getting a real bad green lantern vibe..... Sam J will hold this movie up if he can. Also...... please tell me she gets thanos “poofed” after credits. You did good getting rid of all the fluff characters and now you’re introducing more 🤦🏻‍♂️. Thor, Iron man, hulk, Captain America vs Thanos. That’s the money shot, don’t blow it marvel!!!
She will be the one to kickThanoses ass with one punch
Oh Shit, oh shit, oh shit! I have my tickets preordered. Hee-hee
1:31 When millenials get tired of baby bommers's shit.
White girl at it finest.
anyone else holding their breath because of the drum bass?
I think the Grandma was skrull
I don't know who idea it was too show Carol punching an old lady, but thank you very much because that was hilarious. The old lady was most likely a Skrull anyway.
When she punched the old lady that's when I knew she was the type of lady you bring home to Mom.... So she could punch her in the FACE
Nuuuuuuuuu grandma!
Why did she punch the granny
The old lady reminds me of the worst thing Thanos has ever done. Aka, help an old lady cross the street. (Google the worst thing Thanos has ever done for details.)
Any Dc fans here hit like
Watch the grandma punching scene in slow motion
So many comments about the granny getting hit.
OMG did you see that captain Marci just hit a gramma that is just Savage 1o1
The reason she punched the old lady is because that elf looking creature is a skrull and is camoflauged as the old lady.
Lol captain marvel sounds like a 7-year old girl trying to sound like a woman
Oh shit. This trailer sucked. I hope this isn't representative of the movie to come! I really want to like it.
1:33 Oh shit its young Coulson!
Did she just punch an old lady??? 😳
Grandma: Batman
So is grandma jones the villain or what? Im sorry miss jackson, oooh, i am for real...lol

Can't wait to be told that this is the greatest superhero movie of all time and that I'm sexist if I think otherwise
1:30 When Grandma says something racist at Thanksgiving dinner.
Her voice isn't even badass, she just sounds like a random white chick lmao
Looks like Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern 🤷🏾‍♂️
Tongue punch her fart box 👅
Captain marvel punches and old ladies HYPE BOYYYYYY .Okay this is better than shazam trailer but i think aquaman is still better (mostly marvel fan here)
I guess that nice old lady was a *SKRULL!*
Can we talk about the old lady who got punched in the face?
So I hope the old lady she punched was actually a Skrull or else this might be a really uncomfortable scene XD
propaganda Disney shit make this stuff great, trust me.
It looked fine.  It is a tease, people.  We still got six months before the movie even hits.  It is just supposed to get you talking about it.  No real plot details were shown.  More a proof of concept for the more casual fans.  In probably another two months we will get that more "epic" trailer.
Oh shit isnt that captain falcon. Change ur damn title DC
*Punches elderly woman in the face*
Poor grandma, LOL 😂😂
I think it was dumb to show her punch an old lady in a trailer.
Old lady: Hello is this your seat?
1:31 She obliterated that old lady, sent her to the shadow realm bruh 😂😂
When she hits that old lady.😂😂😂
Moreover, literally pull up the doctor strange trailer, iron man 3 trailer, even the ant-man trailer and ben c, rdj, and paul rudd are pulling similar serious and stoic faces throughout the 2 minutes of trailer footage. Saying Brie Larson is emotionless based on a 2 minute trailer that doesn't even feature just her in every single cut is totally ridiculous. This isn't a comedy film. It may have elements of comedy in it like tons of the mcu films do but this isn't guardians of the galaxy or thor: ragnarok. This is a different tone, different hero, different character. Photoshopping smiles onto her face is sexist and shite tbh She's a superhero. She shouldn't be smiling through every moment of the film. Was Robert Downey Jr supposed to be smiling throughout the iron man 3 trailer? No. Because that would totally upset the tone and just be stupid. Let a woman be serious ffs
Same old story with feminine touch..
is granny punching a thing?
tbh I didn't give a rat's ass about the Captain Marvel post credit scene but now... yeah now I do holy shit
When she punched an old lady I was like “What The Hell?🤣” Then I remembered that the Skrulls are villains in the movie. I have enough Marvel Comics knowledge to know, as well as other Marvel Fanboys do, that the Skrulls have the ability to shape-shift into any person so that old lady was a Skrull.
Did she really punched an old women?
Peeps.. hold your horses! This is just the first teaser trailer! Expect a more action filled next time...
she is not even 1% of thanos power , stop your feminist shit, its embarassing
1:30 why did she punch the old lady lik wtf 😂
Captain Marvel: Hold my beer.
Captain Marvel Vs Grandma, who is the winner? 😂
The old lady might be Skrull.
Captain Marvel's power is punching defenseless old grannys
1 like = 1 old lady punched in the face.
You know shits goin down when they eyes light up
Haha yeah I love beating the shit out of old people!!
What a Bullshits
it would be epic if that old lady is just an old lady and everyone will be like why da fuq did you punch her
captain marvel punches her
One question why add the old lady smacking in the trailer
1:30 when you want to do that when parents do the same thing as you but they scold you 
There better be a really damn good explanation for captain marvel punching an old lady 👀
Lmao she just hit an old women in the face!
Powers look cool, she looks cool. I’m sold. 👍🏻
I heard a theory going around the internet that Nick Fury knew to contact Captain Marvel at the end of Avengers: Infinity War because when Dr Strange was meditating & looking at the possible futures, when he finally saw the future where the Avengers had won, he realized that Captain Marvel was there & found out that Nick Fury was a friend of Captain Marvel & he astrally projected himself into the past & met both of them & briefed them about the future when Thanos snaps his finger & wipes out half the universe then Nick Fury must contact Captain Marvel to assist the Avengers in the Avengers 4 movie & also that's how Hydra knows about Dr Strange in Captain America: The Winter Soldier even though the Dr Strange movie is after The Winter Soldier  - If it is true will it be a post credit scene?
1:31 hey Grandma there's something on your face! 
This is shit
1:31 seriously ? You hit old women ? Shame captain 😑
1:30 when grandma said henry cavil wasnt superman.
Old lady is a skrull

*Grandma was a SKRULL, of course*
5 seconds in and there’s a blockbuster. Sold.
If that old lady is a real old lady I’m gonna feel so bad for her
These movies are getting sooo old. Not even that entertaining anymore, tbh
What da hell did that grandma do to u ?!
I think a lot of people are going to be mad that she punched an old lady but unless you know about the skrulls and the shapeshifting powers then you would understand
Only a few seconds into the video and I can already tell this is gonna be a *Blockbuster* hit
Damn she snapped on the grandma
Holy shit hell yeah😎
R. I. P. Granny
y punch old woman
This looks like shit smh
Soo.. She is older Than Cap Roger or..
She just punched an old lady I'mma need context for that one
This is the same bullshit we all know that the good guys will win in this movie so why even watch it
Guys, Atleast you're only looking at a trailer, there’s unfinished cgi, in this movie. When it comes out. You'll see they finished and the new shit they done, Calm down. It’s not like they just finished a unfinished movie.
Let's face it. The old lady is gonna be some kind of a villian shapeshifter of some sort.
people who dont know why the grandma getting hit dont have the right to see this movie
That poor grandma
After months pf waiting, here it is. ❤. Can't wait for the movie to hit the theaterssss. We love you Captain Marvelllll!!!😁☝
The most interesting part of this trailer was the old lady getting hit.
Holy shit! CAPTAIN MARVEL looks like what GREEN LANTERN should've looked like back in 2011. But only good.
That grandma didn’t stand a chance 😂
Blockbuster make me feel old...😕😕📼
Is that one guy with the gold eyes supposed to be Mar-Vell?
Imba superhero like superman or one punch man  ?
Ooooohhh, grandma gets some punch!
61K dislike probably misunderstand that Captain Marvel is a villain because she hits an old lady.
Old Lady.. In Hell !!
Now I see why they were holding the trailer back. I’m surprised all the likes. Did marvel pay for them? This looks kind of terrible. Lol 
Captain Marvel hits an old lady.......is the OLD LADY her MOTHER-IN -LAW ??????
I’m betting a million that if Captain Marvel was played by some cute white boy that was dorky, the world would have no trouble accepting Captain Marvel into the MCU family.
Hit Like If You Eager to know why Fury hid Her till infinity war. 🤔🤔
This is why Grandmas should always keep the sweet cupboard fully stocked
What did that old lady ever do you Ms. Marvel?
Wow, what a piece of shit
shit of mcu is coming...
I suppose we all know that old lady was actually a Skrull
Wtf shit trailer
1:31 When grandma thinks she made a funny bash on me but it lowkey hurt
I haven't enjoyed an mcu movie since Winter Soldier. This is the first one to look promising in a while. Maybe without James Gunn in the picture anymore, the goofy jokes will finally be a thing of the past.
What makes you a hero... Punch an old lady on the face!! 😐😐😐
Punching the old (Skrull) lady looks wicked cool. Can't wait!
or maybe not and she just gave an old woman a right hook, for looking at her funny.
she punch an old lady. what a hero
1:30 when your grandma doesn’t give you money for Christmas
I really hope that old woman wasnt a skrull
32 million views in 3 days? RESPECT!  Plus who doesn't appreciate a woman who will give grandma love tap?
Spoiler alert - grandma is loki
Tbh I wouldve clocked that Grandma too lmao.. Her laugh is evil....
That old lady punch is legit one of the best things I’ve ever seen, this will live on as one the triggers to my funny bone
okay, but why is she punching an old lady? Doesn´t seem very heroic
Grandma got marvelled! ☺️
Oh please people!!  It clearly wasn’t a real old lady.  Can we save the comments for when we’ve actually seen the damn movie!!!  🙄
you would think after the Masterpiece that was the Thor Ragnarok teaser that they have learned by now how to make the Audience hyped and excited for a new entry to the series but then they give us this shit seriously I slept halfway through and what's with her voice? it sounds too whiny and annoying if she turns out to really be stronger than Thor it will fell forced and unearned
*punches an elderly woman in the face*
Yawn........same old same old
Nice ! Bold ! Action Packed Trailer ?! Waiting eagerly !!?!!
Punching 👵🏼 in the face ✅ 
As someone who loves their grandma, I'm out 
How does she get to the point of punching grandma Betty?
1:30 when you give grandma your seat then wants to take it back
Won't this video get demonitized because hit elderly people 😄
This shit looks bad. Hopefully it's the beginning of Marvel's downfall. The Illuminati deserve to fail. Probably won't be though cause of satan and shit or whatever
Shittiest trailor ever
Me: Must be the fate for this potentially shitty movie
More politically correct shit.
Avengers?? We are waiting for that movie not some girl slapping old ladies
those saying brie is expressionless in the trailer should rewatch the part where she hits the old lady
Punch em grannies right in the face 🔥
My favorite part was when she punched the grandma in the brain.
This Trailer : piece of shit
The grandma was a skrull i think
damn she done smacked the shit out that grandma 💀💀
bruh she cracked some old lady in the face, prolly deserved it tho
When Granny saks you to slap her
Honestly, I'm only interested in why she punched the old lady.
Old lady : _"No"_
2014 Captain America : The Winter Soldier Guardians of the Galaxy and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 
Holy shit, it looks amazing!
1:31 lmaoo they showed her punching that old lady like it was some kind of badass moment 😂 Movie looks trash btw
But hey to you that are probably going to dislike bomb my comment about your supposedly new favourite superhero, remember that in this trailer the actors face didnt blink or emote once and its about a female pilot getting super powers, yknow whats another movie that had a pilot that gains super powers? Now im not saying the movie is going to be bad as Green Lantern i mean at least Green Latern had Ryan Reynolds, Captain Marvels main lead is reeeeaallly stale. But im sure the audience that enjoy this movie probably watched Marvel punch a old lady over and over and thought that was funny.
*beta males in scenario 2*: "wow guys holy shit we just saw the entire movie, they spoiled the entire thing"

I like the part where she punched the old lady.
Solid....its hit movie 👌👌
At first I thought she punched a nice old lady then remembered the kree
What makes her a hero? Punching old ladies
And marvel just killed the MCU.  It finally happened.  Wow this is going to suck.  Why does she sound like she’s a 14 year old girl.  Ughh. Her acting is horrible
Behold the first marvel flop
Grandma gets punched right in piehole and like dayyyyyuuuummmmm
I wonder what the grandma did, to deserve getting sucker punched xD
Bullshit movie made

1:30 did she just disrespect that old woman?!!!😂😂😂
Captain marvel mistaken granny for thanos 🤣💀🤣
This movie isnt meant to really be action packed I guess. It's a back story leading to the bad ass shit in avengers 4. I think this movie will be great just not Godly amazing like other marvel movies. I cant wait for this movie. Plus it's only the first trailer so who knows what's to come. But they sure did pull off making this movie look older.
Not the captain Marvel from the comics. This is shit.
punching grannies is what makes heroes, apparently
This must have happened way before the Avengers and shit because Nick fury has hair
Just calling it: If you say shit like "Marvel's pushing their feminist agenda, now their movies are gonna suuck", you are sexist.
Did she punch an old  lady and why lol
Captain Marvel, granny puncher.
Discover. What makes. Her a HERO. *punches old granny*
I guess her grandma didn't feel so good
oh lord she just punched an old lady
The reason she punched the old lady was because it was a Skrull probably.
PLOT TWIST- Granny wasn’t actually a Skrull
What's this feminist shit
I see avenger s is going to play out like this captain marvel will weaken him and every single every will hit him and the guanle t will fall off  and iron man will hold the guanlet because tha thanos and iron man are alike only one is good and one is bad
No one gonna say anything about the old lady getting decked?
1.32 Hmmm, she smacked the old man.
captain marvel punching grandma gif for meme please
BRUH! i really wasn't sold but after watching the trailer it's looks like its going to be fuckin LITTY!
Other than the callback to Blockbuster and watching Carol deck an old lady in the face, I'm getting real DC vibes from this trailer, and that's worrisome.
Punches old lady that’s a hero
when you just hate grandmas 1:30
She punched an old lady... so that's why she's been missing in all past MCU movies, Nick Fury could have sent her on "exile"
Plot twist: Captain Marvel was the skrull and the grandmother was a poor old woman who sat in his seat
The Great Grandma
1:30 When your grandma doesnt understand a meme.
Captain Marvel: Bring me Grandma
I laugh when she punched the old lady 😂
she just punched that sweet oh lady. son of a b***h!
O its mean she is old like captain america😂
Until she punched grandma
looks like shit
1:30 when grandma wasn't nice to you as a kid
Punch that skrull grandma in the face.
Wow a blockbusters this is old
Im almost 100 percent sure the old lady is a Skrull!
Captain marvel fans hit like pleas
maybe you can add "saitama" in the anime one punch man so that thanos dies with one hit
Punching grandmas in the face is tight
This shit is as Dope as my shit Dope<3
Oh my gosh nick fury is so adorable young and this looks so...so awsome, let’s hope this woman can punch thanos in the head instead of the old woman.
Ya know it's old timey when the first shot is at BLOCKBUSTER
Well done!! Another hit for sure.
Proceeds to punch an old lady
My god she punched an old lady
The person to save the world from Thanos just punched an old woman...
"space invasion, big car chase, truth to be told I was ready to hang it up till I met you today"- every marvel fan
That looks shit, simple!
Seeing Blockbusters again makes me feel old...
It took many avengers and standalones for cap .. tony..Thor to get hyped and see here not even a single appearance but the most awaited one in no time..lol lucky she knows it’s a hit already for sure
Old lady: Mabye ;)
ahahaha did she just smack the shit out of an old lady 1:30 😂
Did you know that there is still one blockbuster left, but who cares about that shit, Brie Larson is the best actresses for this role and it looks amazing, I can’t wait!
The grandma is definetly a skrull, does anyone here know anything about Marvel?
when ur grandma gives u too many cookies
Why’d she punch that old lady tho?? 😂
1:30 she was just asking if she ate. RIP Grandma
Typical feminist bulshit. Smh 🤦‍♂️ can’t they came with any other word other than “We have no idea what we’re dealing with” ?? 😒
another white people being aliens
The old lady could possibly be a skrull, a shapeshifting being that is a direct enemy of the kree
Everyones flipping shit about this trailer saying it sucks when it barely even shows any parts of the movie. If it explained the whole plot in the trailer you'd all be bitching too. Jesus, what makes people you happy?
Pure Gold.
what did grandma ever do to you ... ?
When grandma turns off your fortnite shes here to save the day
Ooooooh shit is she gonna go full on Binary!? LOL have fun whoever faces that.
I'm glad Captain Marvel and I have something in common in that we both blasted into a Blockbuster and smacked a grandma on the bus.
The old lady is a skrull shape shift into a human
*punching old lady*
“She just slapped an old lady omg”
1:31 MCU hitting DCEU.
This shit is gonna reach millions of views
Why you punch my grandma? 😭
" Shut up, you old bag."
This Shit is Legendary
Hit like if do you remember  *mr stark i don't feel soo good* 😫😫
I'm intrigued. However, i'm not completely sold on larsons performance.
Guess Grandma didn’t wanna go to Shady Oaks 🤣
Everyone on the train or bus whatever there on will be wondering why she smacked that old lady 😂
Captain granny slaper
The negative reviews and feedback for this film will be blamed on misogynists and angry white males. 
grandma is a threat
They had me at her hitting the old lady.
Yhis traler is bullshit
Holy shit blockbusters haven’t seen that in a long time
Why did she hit Stan lee 1:31 that’s Stanctis
1:31 she slapped the shit out that old lady 😂😂
Captain Marvel: thor told you, You die for that This time I will go for head
Best part when she punched the crap out of the old lady XD
Let the feminazi...girl power bullshit begin...
1:31 when your grandma dosent make you cookies
This is utter bullshit
captain marvel is about that life huh "would you hit this old lady for 1 billion dollars meme" lol
That old lady called her Shazam.
The old lady she punched is actually...
she punched a smiling grandma. INSTANT DOWNLOAD
Ok now who said this that the  old lady is MGK in disguise ?
Forget half of the trailer. I'm watching just to know why she punched that old lady
When granny won’t give you any food 1:30
The old lady had it coming
Unless he's just some shitty throwaway cameo.
Very disappointing trailer. I was hyped for the trailer and all that is gone.and Kevin fiege bullshit.
Yay another formulaic shitty marvel movie
Lol what did Grandma do?
Why'd she punch grandma???
She is punching an old lady for Christ's sake; What normal person can't do that?
This honestly looks crap the skrulls look shit I think this will be even worse than green lantern definitely not wasting my money on this
Edit: Stop commenting about shit other people are saying and posting on MY comment. I like humour, and I think it’s missing this.
That Old lady was Wonder Woman
I hope this movie shows how Fury lost his eye. He said in Winter Soldier "last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye" so I think a skrull in disguise will do it.
the music is hype af. her voice though. too white girly. still excited for the movie
Hit that like button harder than Captain Marvel hit that grandma
I still prefer the old Captain America....but damn this looks good
Ouhhhh shitttttttttttttttttt
Old Lady’s jaw: I don’t feel so good👨🏾‍💻
Marvels AVENGERS Grandma War 1:30
So what? Is she like the leader of the Avengers or some shit? She just looks like Superwomen to me
Wow... What a piece of shit.
What did poor grandma do?
Am I the only one who got a Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern vibe from this trailer?
Looks like a DC movie. Meaning shitty
I’m sorry did she just punch an old lady at 1:30.
Why am I getting Green Lantern vibes from this shit ?
Bull shit we want the avengers not this female shit
YUP, beating the elderly is by far the most interesting backstory to how someone got their superpowers. old folks better watch out.
Mary Sue, is that you? The only thing that I am excited about regarding this movie is how Nick Fury lost his eye and for the return of a great character from the old avengers and one of Marvel's TV shows.
Feminists: "This is how women would have been if white men had never intervened"
Şehitler ölmez ❤ 
1:31 old people hater's be like
She punches an old lady probably skull but still lol
Carol Danvers: Puncher of the elderly and the reason why Blockbusters went extinct.
Another movie portraying white people as our hero's. Tired of this bullshit. Every race should have a super hero movie not just one all the time. Not empressed by this trailer
Excited for this new hit
Crashes into Blockbuster and punches a grandma....man what an ass
Did she just punch a old woman right in the face?
*shits about to go down*
Looked like granma firmed that punch tho
Lmao, hope that old lady’s name is Martha
Don't hit the grandma :(
Did she actually punched an old lady😅
I liked the part when she smacked the old lady, reminded me of GTA IV
You cant expect every movie to be like infinity war, this movie does not have a 50+ star cast. Its a solo hero movie , anyways it will still be a far better movie than any dc shit
My friend was like "Did you see the new Captain Marvel trailer?" "No. I'm so burned out on superhero movies." "Dude, she punches an old lady in the face." SOLD.
0:39 Nick fury holding an ice pack to his eye!
Hold up, isn't the guy from 1:21 from agents of S.H.I.E.L.D the one who played the new director with "inhuman" abilities?
your great grandma watched this
5,200 Chitauri disliked this video so far... Smh
Why she punch an old lady?
That old lady must’ve been a Skrull lol! The actress is perfect for the part!!! Most marvel heroes look bored you dorks.
Fun fact, that old lady was not actually a skrull (Carol just likes punching the elderly)
This genuinely looks shit and im a true marvel fan!
Did... Did she just punch an old lady?
That old lady is a Skrull people calm the F down.
This is seriously the worst marvel movie trailer ever released. It seems like they have so much content to use ..they could of made a really good trailer out of it. The dialogue from her sounds cringe and the music sucks..and there is no "oh shit this movie is gonna rock" parts at all. It's just like...ok captain marvel is a thing ...cool..
Anyone notice she's fake-holding that rope @1:08
The only thing interesting in this trailer is Captain Marvel punching a skrull disguised as an old lady. Everything else is kinda... Same as usual Super Hero movie trailer, nothing spectacular. I'll wait to see more before I write this off.
Brie Larson looks too old and fat. Marvel should have hired a better looking actress for the role
DISCOVER.WHAT MAKES. HER A HERO. *punches old lady in the face*
before you complain about her acting check out Earth's Mightiest Heroes cartoon if you want a taste of Carol Danvers coldness.. it's very much on purpose. she's perfect
"i'm not what you think i am" is probably said by every white woman on earth lmao
That old lady is ronan 😂😂
Looking back at some of the past Marvel trailers, Winter Soldier got me all intrigued, Doctor Strange got me all pumped up, Spiderman Homecoming  and Guardian of the Galaxy made me laugh hard, Civil War trailer got me so excited i didn't know what to do with  myself. Black Panther gave me chills like nobody's business. I couldn't get rid of the grin on my face whenever I saw the  Ragnarok trailer. As for Infinity War, let's just say, I had so many different emotions just watching that trailer that I didn't know what the hell was happening to my body......That being said, this trailer on the other hand just feels a bit.......underwhelming.....but it's no matter.
Woah I saw ray Arnold from Jurassic park
Captan Marvel punched an old lady :O 1:30
*Punches an old woman's face*
*Holy shit.*
*fuckin punches an old lady square in the jaw*
Cant wait to find out why she punched the old lady...
99% comments: Captain Marvel punched a grandma
Did anyone else die when Nick says"we have no idea what threats are out there" and Brie Larson punches an old lady 😂😂😂
Samuel L. Jackson finds a white girl? Is this a remake/reboot of "Black Snake Moan"? Will he chain her to a radiator?
Why Captain Marvel Punching an Old Lady in the Face
Weird trailer. I feel like all people will remember of it is bad cgi and her beating the shit out of a grandma
Holy shit she turned super saiyan
Oh shit super woman hit an old lady I’m calling the police
She knocked that old lady into afterlife
Yooo she folded that old lady 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Absolutely 100% certified boring shit this is. It's gonna completely suck.
1:32 poor old lady getting the crap beat out of her for no reason. Also, why does Captain Marvel have green in her costume instead of red?
Looks like generic shit to me..
Reminds me of Johny English beating up the old woman
That shot of her punching a grandma is gonna be a meme, calling it now
Lol that old lady is internet famous now
That old lady is young Thanos confirmed.
that grandma is a skull
lmao that lovely old lady is thanos in disguise
I really enjoyed this trailer. The poor old lady was Loki in disguise for sure.. I hope.
Why no one is talking about how captain marvel destroyed the last blockbuster,and the fuking poor grandma
Look extremely boring , like paint by number boring . But as Brie Larson said ,  i'm a white dude , so this movie is not for me , i won't see it anyway .
Who puts an unexplained 'granny punch' in a trailer?
Grandma :Are you single
Why is everyone so upset that granny got punched?
- Punching the Grandma
I read "Discover what makes a hero" and then She punches grandma
You can’t make this shit up
Say whatever you want, but One-Punch Man's Saitama is still the greatest hero ever.
Şehitler ölmez v❤ 
1:31 *punches grandma*
She's HOT. For a 50-year-old.
She knocked the hell out of granny
**punches old lady in the face*
Captain America fans hit the unlike button...
Her 8-year-old voice is really..... not what I expected :/
"That shit Kree." - Kanye West
Captain Marvel punching an old lady in the face is really something
Hopefully they don't use captain marvel in infinity war part 2 like DC used superman in justice league, when the entire movie was just a long wait for one guy to show up and carry the entire fight against some apparent world destroyer who can't even land a punch on him.
Angry Girl face vs old people
1:31 what the heeelll, poor granny!
You're gonna catch a cold
Take that Grandma!!!
Is the old lady the only person she punches in the whole movie?
When my grandma doesn't have my waffles ready 1:31
That grandma was a shifter . For upcoming avengers movie
1:30 How I feel about old people on the interstate
Punched an old lady huh? Must've been a skrull. Secret invasion anyone
Why did she punch that grandma
1:30-1:32 Damn she really had to do that old lady like that
Damn. What did grandma do!?
Finally a legit trailer and not some bullshit fake trailers
1:31 *when your grandma doesn’t give you any of her mints...*
Soundtrack, Cinematography, young Coulson & Fury, the Blockbuster/old Woman joke, THAT MOTHERFUCKNG MOHAWK! and ofc the binary mode = pure perfection & loving the "her" to "hero" transformation <3
1:30 when ur xbox batteries are gone and u see grandma using them for her sewing machine
Idk what other people are seeing in this trailer that is throwing them off... It looks amazing to me. I like that the tone seems a bit more serious too. I don't like how all of Marvel's movies have been following the bathos-comedy style of Guardians of the Galaxy recently where nothing can be serious for long before someone makes a stupid joke. This one seems to have a touch more seriousness along the lines of Winter Soldier, and I'm really happy about that.
Captain Marvel, godly being and puncher of grannies.
Terrible pice of shit!!! this movie is going to fail for sure
that granny is probably a skrol the shapeshity dudes ya know
is anyone wondering why she punched a old lady =P
Grandma is obviously a kree/skrull whatever they're called
It looked fun how after the words "A HERO" she punches an old lady at 1:31 .
Costume looks like shit. More excited to see the Blockbusters than Danvers.
Yay white captain marvel
1:29 that moment when grandma won't stop giving you food
This shit is gonna flop harder than the green lantern
*Punches old lady smiling*
Overpowered piece of shit i just hope that movie fails big time worst addition to mcu 👎
Jesus I can’t stop to replay she punch the old lady
Meme squad , hit like
Hit a like if you are Agents of shield fan.
I love how she right hooked that old woman so hard
This trailer was shit
Another shitty superhero film, can't wait.
Smilegate?  The day women stop "resisting" is the day they will have equal footing.   A man wouldn't give a chit.  We shrug and click on the next nonsense.
Sees a granny smiling at her. Proceeds to punch the granny with superhuman strength. Good way to introduce the character Marvel.
DC : Awesome trailers = Shitty Movies 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Grandma the new meme !
I'm getting some serious YA vibes from this movie. Like, solo movie, moody female lead that has to regain her memories and train her powers, hunted by a greater society, led and mentored by an older male veteran, sunset filter everywhere... I dont know, man. I watch this and the divergent trailrs side by side and altjough totally different, they give me the same vibes
Shit! It’s gonna be one of “those” movies! It will flop on box office and the feminists will blame ‘toxic men’ for the bad movie
1:30 rip grandma
Guessing the old woman is a skrull
Thats my grandmother rip my grandma😭
Huh. Not sold on this actress yet.
Captain Marvel be punching old ladies 🤣
Punched the shit out of that grandma
Everyone giving it shit for looking so serious, but honestly, if marvel can pull of the grit that they used to (ie Iron man 1, thor) I'de welcome a good old fashion throwback. Im sure there will still be comedy, they just are holding off on it. I feel like everyone is casting judgements on the movie just by the trailer. People are literally "judging the book by its cover." Chill, its marvel, they'll pull it off, they always do.
Oh a new marvel hero..*punch a older woman in the face* ohhh .. ok
This shit is fire but why she had to mack granny like that ?💀😭
grandma is a skrull
I'm sure that the old lady is some evil alien in disguise, but her getting punched out of context is gold.
Nobody is going to mention her punching that old lady?
Did she just punch that old lady
=                                      RIP old granny
She punched that old lady in the face like it was nobody's business.
Damn, she slapped the taste out that old b*****s mouth.
Hero: Punches a grandma
Grandma-"Candy?"
Every indian teenagers are going to watch this movie in hall...and there are 25crore+  teenagers in India...that mean this movie gonna hit 100+ billion dollars only from India....and i will be the one.... LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE.
for everyone wondering, the reason why she punched the old lady is cause she’s probably a skrull, and in the comics one of their abilities is shape-shifting. that mask though🤤 i would love to get a khamala khan reference (ms marvel)
Cap marvel fans hit like  🔥  🔥
Did she just punch an old lady?!
She punched an old lady at 1:30. Some superhero you are.
1:30 I'd hit that
The fragile old lady refused to give her seat up so she got punched.
1:29 when grandma decides to not give you money for your birthday
Damm She punched a old lady
*Punches*
Captain marvel;" who wins me or or shazam. Old lady;" shazam" captain marvels just slaps the lady 🤣😅😂
Oh my god, she punched the old lady!
Is it just me or does the music sound REALLY similar to the older Marvel opening logo theme?
Still not sold on Marvel making her the most important character ever but we'll see.
Granny: Shazam is the real Captain Marvel. 
Hit the likes 👍👍
I died when she punched the old lady
Don’t punch Grandma!
Bro why’d she punch a grandma
Blockbuster!!!!!!!!!RIP my old friend
This is shit.. I am not at all hyped for this after watching this trailer.
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man!?!?!?!?!?
I swear there better not be a sad scene where she legit punches a sweet old woman
Coulsons back from tahiti.
damn she straight up punched an elderly woman
She is the most powerful Avenger and she Sucker Punched an old lady? Ouch!
Well, that was both amazing yet told us nothing at all. If you know nothing about this movie you just saw Captain marvel punch an old lady for seemingly no reason
"Captain marvel is the most powerful character" (punches old lady) 😂😂
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that she just straight up decked an old lady?
1:31 she hit an old lady wtf
She just knocked out an old lady's teeth out
Even got Coulson in this?? I’m already sold.
I'd be happy if we get old-school violent, insane and bloodthirsty Carol instead of YAY CAROL CORPS. 
punching grandma is the most bad ass thing a superhero can do
I hope the Granny aka The Skrull did put up a good boxing match against Captain Marvel.
Good old Marvel trailers. Didn't understand a thing.😆
Hahaha she punched the shit outta that old lady!
My hope for this movie is that it's an hour and a half of Carol Danvers punching the shit out of little old ladies until one turns out to actually be a Skrull.
Wait why she punch the old lady lol
99% of the comments talking about the old lady getting punched
Hits old lady
1:31 When the card from Grandma has no money in it
Did she just slap an old lady
Im very excited to find out why she punched that gran.
R.I.P grandma, was probably just trying to make gingerbread cookies for her grandchildren
Granny: a Shazam comic book.
1:31 when yo grandma burns the cookies
I don't care about anything. If they reveal the mystery behind Nick Fury's missing eye, I'm sold.
Flinched with the granny seen tho 😲
Why she gotta go punch Granny like that though?
Punches Grandma 😂
*punches an old lady in the jaw a second later*
When she beamed tf outta that old lady 💀
Thumbs up for punching that old lady!!

The old woman was confirmed to NOT be a skrull, she was just in carols seat.
1:31 wtf she is so old
That old Lady is Skrull
she beats the grandma 1:30  and 1:44 she says she is not a hero ,i mean what i thinked of her
When a old lady is taking your seat  in bus1:29
So... Captain marvel hates old men/ladies on her seat
So she just happens to be an alien who is a blond blue-eyed white European check?..
Poor grandma...awesome trailer...😎
She punched an old woman?
you dont need to be critically acclaimed to know capeshit is going to be normal or shitty, you've seen one you seen them all with the expcetion of the batman trilogy and ramis spiderman, that type pf perfection wont be achieved again
spoiler alert: grandma = skrull
Well, when you hit elders you are not a superhero, not even a hero
Heyyy !! that was a nice old lady ! you can't just do that !
29million views holy shit
Did she...did she pimp slap an old lady?
38k dislike because the super hero killed the grandma 👵
I  know btw that the old lady was an alien forgot the name of the race lul
Yes holy shit its out
Holy shit, was not expecting that today... ❤

Hope this shit bombs hard..
Did she just hit a grandma
This trailer makes me wanna choke on my McChicken. (The only thing good about it is when she punched granny in the face)
Lol she smoked granny 😂😂
I’m here before it hits the million mark
Lol punches old lady 😅😅😅😅
Oml did she just hit a freakin grandma lmaoo😂😂
Truth to be told... I like her as Captain Marvel
I wonder if people know that the reason she punched the old lady is most likely because the old lady is a Skrull
>punches old lady
DC superheroes are totally more strong than Marvel Superheroes but their movies are shit until now
1:31 poor old lady. I think it must be a alien or something
Punched that granny in the face. Savage.
did she just hit the old woman?
1:31 When grandma put raisins in cookies.
You can’t hit an old lady
1:30 "How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, Grandma!?"
If you would like to have a genuine discussion about this though, feel free to hit me up.
1:31 ... RIP Grandma
A hero........ a second later shows captain marvel punchs a old lady right in her face
1:27 SO... She just punched an old woman in the face are we gonna ignore that or...
Grandma at 1:30 is Thanos confirmed
She hit the old lady cause she assumed her gender based on caption name. Oh when the discrimination stop!!!!
That aint a skrull she just hate old people
Why punch a old lady, why?
>The movie would actually be more interesting if the old lady wasn't a skrull because it would give Captain Marvel a character flaw.
Wait what? another heroes? for what? to kill thanos? so what next? washing machine-man, grandma-man or another household items that can make u superheroes like iron infused with cloth to become iron-man? simple..
Thanos watched this trailer and shitted himself
It’s probably gonna be a flashback before the avengers were even organized and would probably end currently how her life is while the world is going to shit in the marvel’s universe lol
Bigger plot twist the old lady is Peggy carter
*That old lady must be a skrull* 1:31
Is that her powers? Punching old lady's
1:31 when your grandma asks if you ate for the tenth time
_punches old lady in bus_
*Immediately punches old lady*
Im like liking her until i saw her slap an old lady
Feels like a DC movie, with those bad graphics and chit, it really looks like Supergirl movie, very disappointed this time.
Looks like a shitty CW tv show.
I wonder why she punch an old lady hmmmmmmmmmm
That old lady getting punched is gonna get memed so hard.
Hit like if you think robot 2.0 is better than this
Or how about that time she said she doesn’t want to hear the opinions of white men
